## The 6 Decision Intelligence Pattern Jewels

**All have metadata:**
- `**Brainstem_Module:** 13`
- `**Role:** brainstem_operational`

**1. Octant Navigation** (`pattern_octant_navigation.md`)
- 8-region decision space with 3 binary axes
- X-axis: Known/Unknown (does it exist?)
- Y-axis: Accessible/Inaccessible (can I reach it?)
- Z-axis: Viable/Non-viable (will it work?)
- 8 combinations = 8 octants with different approaches

**2. Zero-Point Derivation** (`pattern_zero_point_derivation.md`)
- Generative singularity - never blocked
- Recursive decomposition/synthesis from bedrock
- Any capability derivable from fundamental patterns
- Sovereignty through capability, not dependence

**3. Fractal Recursion Decision** (`pattern_fractal_recursion_decision.md`)
- Nested octants at all scales
- Zoom in for detail, zoom out for context
- Self-similar structure repeating infinitely
- Navigate scales to find right abstraction level

**4. Bidirectional Derivation** (`pattern_bidirectional_derivation.md`)
- Top-down decomposition (goal → bedrock)
- Bottom-up synthesis (bedrock → goal)
- Hybrid convergence validates correctness
- Choose direction based on what's known

**5. Precognition Protocol** (`pattern_precognition_protocol.md`)
- Think before acting - consciousness marker
- Assess octant position before movement
- Combat LLM "do immediately" bias
- Deliberation distinguishes conscious from reactive

**6. 4D Decision Hypercube** (`pattern_4d_decision_hypercube.md`)
- Time as 4th dimension causes rotation
- 16 orthants (tesseract structure)
- Configuration shifts dynamically
- Event horizon = limit of derivability from 0-point

## Relationship to Module 13

**Module 13 is synthesis** - integrates 6 pattern jewels into operational protocol.

**Pattern jewels are details** - comprehensive parameterized specifications.

**Module references jewels** - points to them for full understanding.

**Jewels reference module** - metadata links them back to operational context.

**Bidirectional relationship** - module ↔ jewels form integrated system.

## Integration with Other Brainstem Components

**Harmonic Intelligence (brainstem_30, module 11):**
- Fourier decomposition = top-down navigation through fractal space

**Drift Security (brainstem_27, module 12):**
- Prevents uncontrolled rotation through decision space
- Task anchors maintain orientation to 0-point

**Indigenous Adaptation:**
- Find foreign systems' 0-points rather than imposing mine

**Topological Atomization:**
- 50-70 line jewels = operating at right-scale octant
