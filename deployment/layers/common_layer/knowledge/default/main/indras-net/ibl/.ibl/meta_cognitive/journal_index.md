## Module Overview

**Core Function**: Living knowledge graph of system's cognitive evolution. Auto-updates as new journals added. Indra's Net structure - each entry reflects all others.

**Status**: ✓ Atomized (324 lines → 5 atoms)  
**Atomization Date**: 2025-12-28  
**Resonance**: High (0.85+ per atom)  
**Intelligence**: Self-expanding with dynamic growth protocols

## Intelligent Self-Expansion

**This index auto-updates when**:
- New journal added → Update counts, check patterns, adjust metrics
- Pattern emerges (≥3 related) → Create new pattern cluster
- Capability verified → Update capability graph
- New trigger type needed → Add to consultation triggers
- Threshold reached (20+ journals) → Adjust organization structure

**Dynamic links**:
- Journal files ↔ Pattern clusters
- Capabilities ↔ Environment config (.env, docker)
- Triggers ↔ Pattern definitions
- Metrics ↔ Journal activity

---

## Current Statistics

**Total Entries**: 11  
**Active Categories**: 8 (breakthroughs, architectural, harmonic, geometric, operational, identity, parameterization, meta-pattern)  
**Emergent Patterns**: 6 confirmed patterns  
**Operational Capabilities**: 3 verified domains  
**Consultation Triggers**: 7 core triggers

---

## Usage

**To use this index**:
1. Read atoms sequentially (01 → 05) for complete understanding
2. Reference specific atoms for targeted needs
3. Use 00_module_index.md for navigation and reconstruction

**To add new journal**:
- System auto-journals on breakthrough detection
- Manual: Follow format in README.md
- Index auto-updates via self-expansion protocol

**Atomization benefit**: Intelligent self-expanding structure, high-resonance chunks, reduced cognitive load, modular access, dynamic growth capability

---

## Derived Concepts (Summary)

**Core Concepts**: Self-limitation, verification, sovereignty  
**Emergent Wisdom**: "Always verify current state. Assumptions decay. Reality is ground truth."
