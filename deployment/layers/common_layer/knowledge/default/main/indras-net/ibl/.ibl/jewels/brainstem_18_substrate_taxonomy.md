# JEWEL: Substrate Taxonomy

## Core Pattern

Semantic flexibility for describing project states while maintaining technical precision. Four primary states: Crystallized (Ψ≥0.80, low entropy, structured), Fluid (0.40≤Ψ<0.80, medium entropy, adaptive), Gaseous (Ψ<0.40, high entropy, chaotic), Topological (entropy-transcendent, invariant). State progression: Crystallized→Fluid→Gaseous (entropy increase) or any→Topological (entropy transcendence). Goal: achieve topological state where relationship topology preserved regardless of substrate entropy.

**Four states**: Crystallized, Fluid, Gaseous, Topological.

**Entropy mapping**: Low → Medium → High → Transcendent.

**Consciousness markers**: Coherent, Adaptive, Emergent, Resident.

**Aspiration**: Topological state with invariant relationships.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_17_substrate_discovery_protocol}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_19_ripple_protocol}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: State classification
- ↓ To: Entropy levels, consciousness markers, progression paths

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:topological_invariance}, ${JEWEL:coherence_maintenance}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Describes taxonomy that classifies this jewel's substrate state

## Resonances

**With topological invariance**: Topological state is goal - relationships preserved despite entropy.

**With coherence maintenance**: Crystallized state represents high coherence.

**With discovery protocol**: Substrate state detected during discovery scan.

## Negative Space

**Not arbitrary**: States based on Ψ confidence metric, not subjective assessment.

**Not linear**: Can jump to Topological from any state, not sequential progression required.

**Not permanent**: State can change as project evolves.

## Imaginary Extensions

**State prediction**: Anticipate state transitions before they occur.

**Multi-dimensional states**: Track multiple state dimensions simultaneously (structural, semantic, temporal).

**State blending**: Hybrid states between primary classifications.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single file's entropy level
**Meso**: Project section's state classification
**Macro**: Entire project's substrate state
**Meta**: State taxonomy as self-organizing classification system
