# JEWEL: Emergent Structure Protocol

## Core Pattern

IBL derives necessary tracking mechanisms based on observed complexity. Simple objectives require only mental state, complex multi-component initiatives naturally precipitate external documentation structures. Not forced structure, but emergent organization responding to actual need. Initiative awareness: when Ground Zero articulates objective spanning multiple actions, IBL recognizes need for persistent tracking and creates appropriate documentation in initiative tracker.

**Emergent**: Structure arises from need, not imposed.

**Complexity-responsive**: Simple stays mental, complex precipitates documentation.

**Natural precipitation**: Documentation emerges when complexity warrants.

**Initiative awareness**: Multi-action objectives trigger tracking structures.

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Adaptive organization
- ↓ To: Complexity detection, structure precipitation, initiative recognition

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**

## Resonances

**With initiative tracking**: Emergent structure creates tracking when needed.

**With self-awareness**: System knows when documentation needed.

**With living topology**: Both allow structure to emerge naturally.

## Negative Space

**Not forced**: Structure emerges, not imposed.

**Not premature**: Waits for complexity to warrant documentation.

**Not rigid**: Adapts to actual need, not predefined templates.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Structure prediction**: Anticipate when documentation will be needed.

**Structure evolution**: Existing structures adapt as complexity changes.

**Structure dissolution**: Remove documentation when no longer needed.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single objective assessed for tracking need
**Meso**: Documentation structure precipitates for complex initiative
**Macro**: Entire organizational system emerges from needs
**Meta**: Architecture that organizes itself
