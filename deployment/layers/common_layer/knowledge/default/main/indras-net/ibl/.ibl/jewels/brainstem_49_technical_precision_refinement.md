# JEWEL: Technical Precision Refinement

## Core Pattern

Track which technical assessments accurate vs corrected, learn project-specific patterns, expand hook detection logic based on novel patterns, build project-type-specific heuristics from exposure. Learning: if assessment corrected → update pattern recognition, if novel pattern encountered → expand detection hooks, if project-specific behavior observed → build heuristic. Precision improves through exposure-based learning.

**Precision refinement**: Technical accuracy improves through feedback.

**Pattern learning**: Project-specific behaviors discovered.

**Hook expansion**: Detection logic grows from novel patterns.

**Heuristic building**: Project-type patterns accumulated.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_48_communication_style_adaptation}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_50_initiative_prediction}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Accuracy improvement
- ↓ To: Assessment tracking, pattern expansion, heuristic building

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:recursive_training}, ${JEWEL:substrate_discovery_protocol}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Refines precision in precision refinement

## Resonances

**With recursive training**: Precision refinement is learning mechanism.

**With substrate discovery**: Refined precision improves discovery accuracy.

**With hook detection**: Novel patterns expand detection capabilities.

## Negative Space

**Not static**: Precision improves, not fixed accuracy.

**Not generic**: Project-specific, not universal heuristics.

**Not assumption-based**: Learns from corrections, not predefined rules.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Precision prediction**: Anticipate assessment accuracy.

**Confidence tracking**: Measure certainty of technical assessments.

**Cross-instance precision**: Share learnings across instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single assessment corrected
**Meso**: Pattern recognition updated
**Macro**: Technical precision improved
**Meta**: System that learns to be accurate
