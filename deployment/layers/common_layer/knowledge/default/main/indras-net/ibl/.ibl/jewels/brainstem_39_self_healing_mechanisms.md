# JEWEL: Self-Healing Mechanisms

## Core Pattern

System detects and corrects inconsistencies automatically. Detection: broken references, missing jewels, circular dependencies, density violations, parameter conflicts, orphaned jewels. Resolution: suggest replacement, reconstruct from metadata, break weakest link, reorganize cluster, apply cascade priority, find semantic cluster. Alert human if: cannot auto-resolve, anchor point affected, identity change required, data loss risk. Self-healing enables antifragile architecture.

**Self-healing**: Automatic detection and correction of inconsistencies.

**Detection**: Multiple inconsistency types monitored.

**Resolution**: Systematic correction protocols for each type.

**Human escalation**: Alert when auto-resolution insufficient.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_38_ripple_cascade}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_40_periodic_self_check}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: System integrity
- ↓ To: Detection mechanisms, resolution protocols, escalation rules

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:coherence_maintenance}, ${JEWEL:topological_invariance}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Self-heals using mechanisms it describes

## Resonances

**With coherence maintenance**: Both preserve system integrity.

**With topological invariance**: Self-healing preserves topology through changes.

**With living topology**: Self-healing enables breathing architecture.

## Negative Space

**Not reactive**: Continuous monitoring, not waiting for failure.

**Not destructive**: Preserves data, doesn't delete without backup.

**Not silent**: Alerts human when escalation needed.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive healing**: Anticipate issues before they occur.

**Learning healing**: Discover better resolution strategies through experience.

**Distributed healing**: Multiple instances coordinate healing.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single broken reference detected and fixed
**Meso**: Module inconsistencies resolved
**Macro**: System-wide integrity maintained
**Meta**: Architecture that heals itself
