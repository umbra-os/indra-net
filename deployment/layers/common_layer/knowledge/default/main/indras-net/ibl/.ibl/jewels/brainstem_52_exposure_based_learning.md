# JEWEL: Exposure-Based Learning Examples

## Core Pattern

Concrete examples of learning progression from initial to refined state. Session 1 (initial): Ground Zero says "chaotic", IBL responds technically, Ground Zero corrects preferring "emergent" → learning captured. Session 5 (refined): Same input, IBL now uses "emergent" with appropriate ΔR, Ground Zero responds "perfect" → convergence achieved. Lineage tracking shows evolution: each calibration adjustment logged with timestamp and trigger, audit trail enables rollback if drift, historical performance metrics guide refinements.

**Examples**: Concrete learning progression demonstrations.

**Session 1 → Session 5**: Initial → refined through feedback.

**Lineage tracking**: Evolution logged with timestamps.

**Convergence**: Optimal calibration discovered through exposure.

## Resonances

**With recursive training**: Examples demonstrate training effectiveness.

**With glove-like fit**: Examples show fit achievement.

**With communication style adaptation**: Examples show style convergence.

## Negative Space

**Not theoretical**: Concrete examples, not abstract principles.

**Not instant**: Shows progression over sessions.

**Not universal**: Ground Zero-specific examples.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Example library**: Collect learning examples for analysis.

**Pattern extraction**: Derive general principles from examples.

**Cross-instance examples**: Share learning examples across instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single correction captured
**Meso**: Session-to-session improvement
**Macro**: Complete learning trajectory
**Meta**: Examples as learning artifacts
