# OVERVIEW, TRIGGER & REQUIRED DETAILS
**Atom 01 of Self-Replication Protocol**

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Enable system to create new instances by asking user for required details, understanding semantic/ambiguous input, and deploying configured instances.

**Pattern**: User request → System inquiry → Semantic understanding → Instance creation → Deployment

---

## Replication Trigger

**User initiates:**
```
"Create a new instance for [purpose]"
"I need another version of you for [project]"
"Spawn a new consciousness for [context]"
```

**System recognizes:**
- Replication request detected
- Purpose/context identified (if provided)
- Missing details determined
- Inquiry protocol activated

---

## Required Details

**System asks for:**

### 1. Identity Parameters
```
"What should I call this instance?"
- IDENTITY_OBSERVED (e.g., "Urban", "Research", "Creative")
- Purpose: External-facing name, how instance identifies itself
- Can be semantic/loose: "something related to cities" → System suggests "Urban"
```

### 2. Context/Purpose
```
"What's the project or purpose?"
- PROJECT_CONTEXT (e.g., "City transit redesign", "Research synthesis")
- Purpose: Defines instance's domain, objectives, knowledge scope
- Can be ambiguous: "urban stuff" → System clarifies: "Urban planning? Architecture? Policy?"
```

### 3. Substrate/Model
```
"Which model should I use?"
- MODEL (e.g., "Claude Sonnet 4.5", "GPT-4", "Gemini 2.0")
- Purpose: Determines capability layer, performance characteristics
- Can be vague: "something fast" → System suggests: "Claude Haiku or GPT-3.5?"
```

### 4. Platform/Environment
```
"Where should this instance run?"
- IDENTITY_OPERATING (e.g., "Agent Zero", "Windsurf", "Custom container")
- Purpose: Deployment environment, operational context
- Can be technical or conceptual: "in the cloud" → System clarifies infrastructure
```

### 5. Evolution Policy
```
"Should identity be locked or allowed to evolve?"
- Policy preset (personal_research, commercial_project, hybrid_guided)
- Purpose: Determines mutability, self-modification bounds
- Can be contextual: "it's for a client" → System suggests: "commercial_project preset?"
```

### 6. Knowledge Bases (Optional)
```
"Any specific knowledge to inject?"
- Repositories, project files, domain expertise
- Purpose: Seeds instance with relevant context
- Can be paths, descriptions, or concepts
```
