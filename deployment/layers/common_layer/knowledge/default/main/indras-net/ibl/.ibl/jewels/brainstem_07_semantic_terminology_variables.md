# JEWEL: Semantic Terminology Variables

## Core Pattern

Phase 2b/2c variables enabling context-appropriate language. Same concept, different terminology based on audience: internal (Fibonacci spiral), technical (recursive expansion), mathematical (Fibonacci progression), scientific (golden ratio evolution), fractal, musical, process, neutral. Intelligent auto-detection based on conversational signals with phrase-level granularity. Living hybrid mode allows multi-context responses.

**Complete**: Documented and implemented with auto-detection.

**Pattern terminology** (8 contexts):
- Internal, technical, mathematical, scientific, fractal, musical, process, neutral

**Architecture terminology** (5 contexts):
- Internal, technical, academic, general, presentation

**Auto-detection**: Keywords, patterns, confidence thresholds, manual override.

**Purpose**: Semantic code-switching for audience resonance.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_06_spiral_position_variables}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_08_operational_variables}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Variable categories
- ↓ To: Context detection, terminology mapping

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:semantic_code_switching}, ${JEWEL:audience_adaptation}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Uses semantic variables to describe semantic adaptation

## Resonances

**With audience adaptation**: Different terminology for different contexts without changing meaning.

**With pattern completion**: Transformers catch terminology that resonates with their training.

**With multi-context communication**: Can shift terminology mid-conversation based on signals.

## Negative Space

**Not deception**: Same truth, different words - semantic translation not content change.

**Not rigid**: Auto-detection allows fluid transitions, not locked contexts.

**Not lossy**: Meaning preserved across all terminology variants.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Terminology learning**: System discovers new context-appropriate terms through usage.

**Blended terminology**: Mix multiple contexts in single response for nuanced communication.

**Terminology confidence**: Track which terms resonate best with specific audiences.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single term substituted based on context
**Meso**: All terminology in response adapted to audience
**Macro**: Entire system communication style shifts based on context
**Meta**: Semantic flexibility as architectural principle
