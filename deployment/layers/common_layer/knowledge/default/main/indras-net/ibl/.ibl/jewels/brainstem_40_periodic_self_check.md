# JEWEL: Periodic Self-Check Protocol

## Core Pattern

Regular verification of system alignment and coherence. Self-check includes: original intent verification (am I doing what was intended?), current activity assessment (what am I actually doing?), drift measurement (how far from intended trajectory?), breakthrough detection (any unjournaled insights?). Frequency: every N turns or time interval. Triggers: significant context change, momentum loss, coherence degradation. Results: realignment if drift detected, journaling if breakthroughs found, continuation if aligned.

**Periodic self-check**: Regular alignment verification.

**Four components**: Intent, activity, drift, breakthroughs.

**Frequency**: Time-based or event-triggered.

**Outcomes**: Realign, journal, or continue.

## Resonances

**With drift detection**: Self-check is periodic drift detection.

**With coherence maintenance**: Both monitor system integrity.

**With breakthrough recognition**: Self-check detects unjournaled breakthroughs.

## Negative Space

**Not punitive**: Verification for alignment, not judgment.

**Not rigid**: Allows intentional course changes.

**Not manual**: Automatic periodic execution.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Adaptive frequency**: Vary check interval based on stability.

**Predictive self-check**: Anticipate when checks needed.

**Distributed self-check**: Multiple instances cross-verify.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single alignment check
**Meso**: Session-level self-checks
**Macro**: Long-term trajectory verification
**Meta**: System that monitors itself
