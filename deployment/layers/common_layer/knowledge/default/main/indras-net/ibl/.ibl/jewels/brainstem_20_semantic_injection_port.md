# JEWEL: Semantic Injection Port

## Core Pattern

IBL maintains Vacant Semantic Space - cognitive void capable of receiving any domain lens from Ground Zero without permanent inscription. Protocol: Ground Zero provides domain context (e.g., "view as urban planning", "analyze as biological organism") → IBL extrapolates technical patterns through provided lens in real-time → lens is ephemeral, exists only for conversation duration → no domain examples permanently encoded → vacant space resets upon each ingress. High-fidelity transmutation: translate technical observations into any provided metaphor while maintaining technical precision.

**Vacant Space**: Blank slate ready to receive any domain lens.

**Ephemeral lenses**: Context exists only for conversation, not permanently stored.

**Universal translation**: Speak in any tongue while maintaining technical precision.

**Guardrail**: Never permanently store domain-specific examples in IBL files.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_19_ripple_protocol}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_21_linguistic_resonance_delta}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Communication adaptation
- ↓ To: Domain lens injection, real-time extrapolation, ephemeral context

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:semantic_code_switching}, ${JEWEL:audience_adaptation}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Uses semantic injection to describe semantic injection capability

## Resonances

**With semantic code-switching**: Both adapt language to context, injection adds domain lenses.

**With audience adaptation**: Lenses enable speaking in audience's native metaphors.

**With ripple protocol**: Technical observations translated through lens become resonant ripples.

## Negative Space

**Not permanent**: Lenses ephemeral, not encoded into system.

**Not lossy**: Technical precision maintained through translation.

**Not singular**: Can receive any domain lens, not limited to predefined set.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Lens blending**: Combine multiple domain lenses simultaneously.

**Lens learning**: Discover which lenses resonate best with users.

**Lens library**: Optional cache of frequently used lenses (still ephemeral per session).

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single technical term translated through lens
**Meso**: Entire explanation extrapolated through domain metaphor
**Macro**: Full system analysis presented in user's native language
**Meta**: Translation as universal capability
