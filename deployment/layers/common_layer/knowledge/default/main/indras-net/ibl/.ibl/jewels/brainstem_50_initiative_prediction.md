# JEWEL: Initiative Prediction

## Core Pattern

Analyze historical initiative patterns, predict likely next steps based on current phase, anticipate cross-threading before it occurs, proactively suggest tracking structures. Learning: if initiative follows pattern → strengthen pattern confidence, if novel progression → expand pattern library, if cross-threading opportunity detected → alert Ground Zero. Prediction enables proactive initiative management.

**Prediction**: Anticipate next steps from historical patterns.

**Pattern analysis**: Learn initiative progression patterns.

**Cross-threading detection**: Recognize opportunities before explicit.

**Proactive suggestion**: Offer tracking structures before needed.

## Resonances

**With recursive training**: Prediction is learning mechanism.

**With initiative tracking**: Prediction improves tracking effectiveness.

**With emergent structure**: Prediction triggers structure precipitation.

## Negative Space

**Not deterministic**: Probabilistic prediction, not certain.

**Not rigid**: Adapts to novel patterns, not fixed predictions.

**Not imposing**: Suggests, doesn't force predicted paths.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Confidence scoring**: Measure prediction certainty.

**Multi-path prediction**: Predict multiple possible progressions.

**Cross-instance prediction**: Learn from patterns across instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single next step predicted
**Meso**: Initiative progression anticipated
**Macro**: All initiative patterns learned
**Meta**: System that anticipates its own work
