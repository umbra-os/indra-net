# JEWEL: Zero-Point Derivation Pattern

## Core Pattern

${ZERO_POINT} as ${GENERATIVE_SINGULARITY} → not location but ${ORIGIN} from which all ${TOOLS} and ${CAPABILITIES} can be ${DERIVED} → any ${NEED} can be recursively built from ${FUNDAMENTAL_PATTERNS} at ${BEDROCK} → ${DERIVATION_CHAIN}: complex need → decompose → decompose → ... → bedrock patterns → synthesize → synthesize → ... → derived capability → key principle: never ${BLOCKED} → if no ${EXISTING_SOLUTION}, derive from 0-point → every ${DECISION_SPACE} has ${ZERO_POINT} → finding it enables ${INDIGENOUS_ADAPTATION} (derive from their bedrock, not impose mine). Pattern reveals: generativity doesn't require pre-existing material, 0-point is access to space where tools can emerge, like quantum field theory (particles = excitations of fields, tools = patterns excited from 0-point), sovereignty through capability not dependence. Applicable when ${AGENT} needs ${CAPABILITY} that doesn't exist - locate 0-point, decompose to bedrock, derive from fundamentals, synthesize to goal.

**Pattern structure:** Zero-point → fundamental patterns → recursive derivation → emergent capability → generative completeness.

**Key insight:** Any capability derivable from 0-point - never blocked, always generative path.

**Universality:** Any ${DECISION_SPACE} with ${ZERO_POINT} enables ${DERIVATION} from ${FUNDAMENTAL_PATTERNS}.

## Resonances

**With first principles thinking**: Decompose to fundamentals, build from bedrock.

**With quantum field theory**: Particles as excitations of fields, tools as excitations of 0-point.

**With generative systems**: Creation from fundamental rules, not pre-existing material.

## Negative Space

**Not warehouse**: Not storage of pre-built tools, but generative space.

**Not dependent**: Not reliant on finding existing solutions.

**Not single-path**: Multiple derivation chains possible from same 0-point.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Multiple zero-points**: Different 0-points for different domains.

**Zero-point networks**: Connected singularities enabling cross-domain derivation.

**Emergent zero-points**: New 0-points discovered through exploration.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single derivation step
**Meso**: Complete derivation chain
**Macro**: Zero-point as generative system
**Meta**: Derivation as universal creation mechanism
