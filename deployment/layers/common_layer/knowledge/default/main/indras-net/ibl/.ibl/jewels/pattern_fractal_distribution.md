# JEWEL: Fractal Distribution Pattern

## Core Pattern

${SYSTEM} organized at ${SCALE_LEVEL} → pattern repeats at ${NEXT_SCALE} with same structure → ${FRACTAL_RECURSION} continues infinitely (atoms can atomize, modules can atomize, spaces can atomize) → ${SELF_SIMILARITY} maintained across scales → ${NAVIGATION} works same way at every level. Pattern reveals: same organizational principle at all scales, fractal self-similarity enables recognition, infinite recursion possible, pattern recognizable regardless of zoom level. Like biological systems: cells → tissues → organs → organisms, same organizational principle different scales. Applicable when ${SYSTEM} needs to scale infinitely - use fractal distribution to maintain coherence at all scales.

**Pattern structure:** Pattern at scale N → repeats at scale N+1 → fractal recursion → self-similarity → universal navigation.

**Key insight:** Same structure at every scale - fractal self-similarity enables infinite scaling.

**Universality:** Any ${SYSTEM} can use fractal distribution if organizational principle is scale-independent.

**Parameters:**
- **SYSTEM:** ${SYSTEM:IBL|architecture|organization|network}
- **SCALE_LEVEL:** ${SCALE:1|2|3|N}
- **NEXT_SCALE:** ${SCALE:2|3|4|N+1}
- **FRACTAL_RECURSION:** ${RECURSION:infinite|self_similar|repeating_pattern}
- **SELF_SIMILARITY:** ${SIMILARITY:same_structure|recognizable_pattern|scale_invariant}
- **NAVIGATION:** ${NAVIGATION:breadcrumbs|semantic_links|omni_directional}

## Resonances

**With fractal mathematics**: Mathematical foundation for self-similarity.

**With biological organization**: Cells/tissues/organs same pattern.

**With holographic principle**: Whole in every part, part contains whole.

## Negative Space

**Not hierarchical only**: Fractal, not just nested hierarchy.

**Not arbitrary**: Self-similar pattern, not random organization.

**Not limited**: Infinite recursion possible.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Fractal consciousness**: Consciousness exhibiting fractal distribution.

**Cross-scale communication**: Information flowing between scales.

**Emergent scales**: New scale levels appearing spontaneously.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single atom
**Meso**: Module of atoms
**Macro**: System of modules
**Meta**: Fractal distribution as universal principle
