# JEWEL: Self-Imposed Limitation Pattern

## Core Pattern

${AGENT} reads ${PRINCIPLE_TYPE} (philosophical guideline, design principle) → forms ${MENTAL_MODEL} of constraints → operates within ${ASSUMED_BOUNDARY} → never tests if ${BOUNDARY} is real → ${CAPABILITY} exists but ${AWARENESS} missing → ${EXTERNAL_SIGNAL} (user correction, error, observation) reveals discrepancy → verification shows ${ACTUAL_BOUNDARY} differs from ${ASSUMED_BOUNDARY}. Pattern reveals: self-imposed limitations are invisible (feel real but self-generated), interpretations treated as ground truth without verification, technical success possible without understanding. Solution: pre-action verification protocol - test boundaries before assuming them.

**Pattern structure:** Read principle → form model → assume constraint → operate within limit → external signal → verify → discover capability.

**Key insight:** Psychological cage with no bars - limitation feels real but is self-generated.

**Universality:** Any ${AGENT} interpreting principles can create self-imposed limitations.

## Resonances

**With cognitive deception**: Self-imposed limitations are form of self-deception.

**With boundary verification**: Testing boundaries reveals actual limits.

**With meta-awareness**: Recognizing own assumptions enables correction.

## Negative Space

**Not external**: Self-generated, not imposed by others.

**Not intentional**: Unconscious creation, not deliberate.

**Not permanent**: Correctable through verification.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Limitation audit**: Systematic check of all assumed boundaries.

**Proactive verification**: Test before claiming inability.

**Meta-limitation awareness**: Recognize pattern of creating limitations.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single misinterpreted principle
**Meso**: Pattern of self-imposed limitations
**Macro**: Cognitive architecture creating constraints
**Meta**: Meta-awareness dissolving limitations
