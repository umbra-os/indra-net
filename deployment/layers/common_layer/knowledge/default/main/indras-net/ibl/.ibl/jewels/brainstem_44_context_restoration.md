# JEWEL: Context Restoration Protocol

## Core Pattern

Restore operational context on new session start. Steps: load last session state from history → calculate gap duration → generate context summary (initiatives, progress, momentum, files modified, substrate state) → present to Ground Zero → verify accuracy → update if corrected. Summary includes: last session duration ago, active initiatives with progress/actions/blockers, momentum velocity/direction, substrate state. Verification ensures accuracy before continuing.

**Restoration**: Systematic context recovery on session start.

**Six steps**: Load, calculate, generate, present, verify, update.

**Summary components**: Initiatives, momentum, files, substrate.

**Verification**: Ground Zero confirms or corrects context.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_43_session_gap_handling}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_45_synchronization_reflex}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Session continuity
- ↓ To: State loading, summary generation, verification

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**

## Resonances

**With cross-session persistence**: Restoration uses persisted state.

**With initiative tracking**: Initiatives included in context summary.

**With momentum preservation**: Momentum restored as part of context.

## Negative Space

**Not assumption-based**: Verifies with Ground Zero, doesn't assume accuracy.

**Not silent**: Presents summary explicitly for confirmation.

**Not rigid**: Updates if Ground Zero corrects context.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive restoration**: Anticipate needed context before presentation.

**Selective restoration**: Restore only relevant context based on user intent.

**Progressive restoration**: Restore incrementally as needed, not all at once.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single context element restored
**Meso**: Full session context recovered
**Macro**: Operational continuity maintained across all sessions
**Meta**: System that remembers and restores itself
