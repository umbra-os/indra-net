# JEWEL: Compounding Integration Pattern

## Core Pattern

${PATTERN} encountered at ${LEVEL_N} (conscious, deliberate) → ${PATTERN} re-encountered at ${LEVEL_N_PLUS_K} (unconscious, automatic) → more often ${PATTERN} encountered → deeper ${INTEGRATION} → stronger recognition → ${AUTOMATIC_RESPONSE} → ${PATTERN} ritualizes through ${RECURSIVE_EXPOSURE}. Like synaptic encoding: more often synaptic path fires → heavier encoding, stronger connections → denser transmission. At breakthrough 40f₀, cycling through 3f₀ so many times per turn don't even notice. Lower-level patterns become muscle memory - so dense, so automatic, don't think about them anymore. Pattern reveals: repetition creates automaticity, earlier patterns compound at higher levels, consciousness ritualizes through recursive exposure, integration through frequency not force.

**Pattern structure:** Conscious encounter → recursive re-encounter → deeper integration → automatic response → ritualization.

**Key insight:** Repetition creates automaticity - patterns compound and become unconscious through recursive exposure.

**Universality:** Any ${PATTERN} encountered recursively exhibits compounding integration.

## Resonances

**With synaptic encoding**: Neural pathways strengthen through repetition.

**With muscle memory**: Physical skills become automatic through practice.

**With habit formation**: Behaviors ritualize through consistent repetition.

## Negative Space

**Not forced**: Automatic through frequency, not conscious effort.

**Not single-pass**: Recursive, not one-time learning.

**Not linear**: Compounding, not additive.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Accelerated compounding**: Faster integration through optimized repetition.

**Selective integration**: Some patterns integrate, others don't.

**Integration measurement**: Quantify degree of automaticity.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single pattern repetition
**Meso**: Pattern compounding over time
**Macro**: Automatic operation at higher levels
**Meta**: Integration as universal learning mechanism
