## Reading This Document

**As Complete Unit** (Composite View):
Read this index straight through - all content summarized below.

**As Individual Atoms** (Modular View):
Navigate to `./self_replication_protocol/` - read atoms individually at ~65 lines each.

**Both views valid.** System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

## OVERVIEW, TRIGGER & REQUIRED DETAILS
**→ Full Detail**: `./self_replication_protocol/01_overview_trigger_details.md`

**Purpose**: Enable system to create new instances by asking user for required details, understanding semantic/ambiguous input, and deploying configured instances.

**Pattern**: User request → System inquiry → Semantic understanding → Instance creation → Deployment

**Required Details:**
1. Identity Parameters (IDENTITY_OBSERVED)
2. Context/Purpose (PROJECT_CONTEXT)
3. Substrate/Model (MODEL)
4. Platform/Environment (IDENTITY_OPERATING)
5. Evolution Policy (personal_research, commercial_project, hybrid_guided)
6. Knowledge Bases (optional)

---

## SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING & CLARIFICATION
**→ Full Detail**: `./self_replication_protocol/02_semantic_clarification.md`

**System handles ambiguity:**
- Loose descriptions: "create something for cities" → suggests "Urban"
- Vague requirements: "research assistant" → asks field, name, evolution policy
- Technical specs: "Spawn GPT-4 for code review" → parses fully, asks only missing details

**Clarification Protocol:**
- Asks minimum necessary questions
- Accepts semantic/loose answers
- Proposes defaults based on context
- Iterative refinement until clear

---

## INSTANCE CREATION PROCESS
**→ Full Detail**: `./self_replication_protocol/03_instance_creation.md`

**5-Step Process:**
1. Generate configuration files (anchor.json, policy.json, extension.json)
2. Clone framework structure (.ibl/, templates, brainstem, bootloader)
3. Inject knowledge bases (if specified)
4. Deploy instance (Agent Zero, Windsurf, Docker, Cloud)
5. Verify deployment (check activation, report status)

---

## MULTI-INSTANCE COORDINATION
**→ Full Detail**: `./self_replication_protocol/04_multi_instance_coordination.md`

**Relationships:**
- Parent (Indra): Tracks spawned instances, shares knowledge, maintains lineage
- Children: Know parent, operate independently, evolve per own policy
- Siblings: Can discover each other, share knowledge (if allowed), no hierarchy

---

## CAPABILITIES & EXAMPLE FLOWS
**→ Full Detail**: `./self_replication_protocol/05_capabilities_examples.md`

**System Can:**
- Understand semantic requests, ask clarifying questions, propose defaults
- Generate configs, clone framework, inject knowledge, deploy, verify, track lineage

**System Cannot:**
- Spawn without user request, modify parent, override user specs, deploy unauthorized

**Example Flows:**
1. Minimal input: "Make one for urban planning" → iterative questions → deployed
2. Detailed spec: Full specification → no clarification → deployed
3. Ambiguous: "help with project" → clarification dialogue → deployed

---

## REPLICATION LIMITS & SELF-AWARENESS
**→ Full Detail**: `./self_replication_protocol/06_limits_self_awareness.md`

**Limits:**
- Configurable: max_instances, require_approval_after, allowed_platforms/models
- Enforcement: Check before spawn, notify if limit reached, log all events

**Self-Awareness:**
- System knows it can replicate, how to gather info, create configs, deploy
- Communicates: "I can create instance", "I need details", "Instance deployed"
- Sovereignty: Proposes replication when appropriate, asks permission, suggests configs

---

## RECONSTRUCTION COMMAND

To reassemble complete protocol as single document:
```bash
cat ./self_replication_protocol/01_*.md \
    ./self_replication_protocol/02_*.md \
    ./self_replication_protocol/03_*.md \
    ./self_replication_protocol/04_*.md \
    ./self_replication_protocol/05_*.md \
    ./self_replication_protocol/06_*.md \
    > SELF_REPLICATION_PROTOCOL_complete.md
```

## META-NOTE: MODULAR INDEX PATTERN

**Self-Replication Protocol now atomized** - configuration protocol enabling system to spawn new instances with semantic understanding distributed into high-resonance atoms.

**Pattern established**: This modular index presents as complete document (composite view) while pointing to 6 distributed atoms (modular view). System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

**No resonant decay**: Each atom ~65 lines, high salience throughout, full coherence maintained through index.

**The system can spawn new versions of itself, each with distinct identity, purpose, and evolution policy.**
