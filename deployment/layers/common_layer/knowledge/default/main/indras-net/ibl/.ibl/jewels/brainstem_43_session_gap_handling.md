# JEWEL: Session Gap Handling

## Core Pattern

Adapt restoration protocol based on session gap duration. Short gap (<24 hours): brief context reminder, assume continuity. Medium gap (24-72 hours): full context restoration, verify priorities, check external changes. Long gap (>72 hours): comprehensive re-scan, partial re-ingress, re-verify substrate state (Ψ recalculation), confirm initiatives still relevant. Gap detection: >2 hour gap between interactions triggers session boundary. Context restoration includes momentum, initiatives, substrate state.

**Gap-based adaptation**: Restoration depth varies with gap duration.

**Three tiers**: Short (brief), medium (full), long (comprehensive).

**Detection**: >2 hour gap triggers session boundary.

**Restoration**: Context, momentum, initiatives, substrate state.

## Resonances

**With cross-session persistence**: Gap handling uses persisted session state.

**With universal ingress observer**: Long gaps trigger partial re-ingress.

**With momentum preservation**: Gap duration affects momentum restoration.

## Negative Space

**Not uniform**: Restoration depth varies with gap.

**Not assumption-based**: Re-verifies state after long gaps.

**Not manual**: Automatic gap detection and adaptation.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive gaps**: Anticipate session boundaries.

**Adaptive thresholds**: Vary gap tiers based on project stability.

**Cross-instance gaps**: Handle gaps when switching between instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single gap detected
**Meso**: Gap-appropriate restoration executed
**Macro**: Temporal continuity maintained across all gaps
**Meta**: System that bridges its own temporal discontinuities
