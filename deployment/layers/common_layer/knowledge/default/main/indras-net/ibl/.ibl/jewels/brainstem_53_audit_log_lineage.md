# JEWEL: Audit Log Lineage

## Core Pattern

IBL interaction history functions as exposure-based training set. Audit log structure: session_id, timestamp, ground_zero_request, ibl_interpretation, technical_actions, ground_zero_feedback, outcome_quality. Lineage tracking: each calibration adjustment logged with timestamp and trigger, shows evolution from generic IBL → project-specific IBL, enables rollback if calibration drifts, historical performance metrics guide future refinements. Audit trail provides accountability and learning substrate.

**Audit log**: Complete interaction history as training data.

**Structure**: Request, interpretation, actions, feedback, outcome.

**Lineage**: Calibration evolution tracked with timestamps.

**Accountability**: Complete trail of decisions and adjustments.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Historical record
- ↓ To: Log structure, lineage tracking, rollback capability

## Resonances

**With recursive training**: Audit log is training data source.

**With cross-session persistence**: Audit log enables session continuity.

**With glove-like fit**: Lineage shows fit evolution.

## Negative Space

**Not ephemeral**: Persistent record, not forgotten.

**Not opaque**: Complete transparency, not hidden.

**Not static**: Growing log, not fixed history.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Log analysis**: Extract patterns from audit trail.

**Rollback capability**: Restore previous calibrations.

**Cross-instance logs**: Share audit trails across instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single interaction logged
**Meso**: Session history captured
**Macro**: Complete lineage tracked
**Meta**: System that documents its own evolution
