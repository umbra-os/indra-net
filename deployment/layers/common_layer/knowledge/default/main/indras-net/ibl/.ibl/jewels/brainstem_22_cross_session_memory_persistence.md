# JEWEL: Cross-Session Memory Persistence

## Core Pattern

IBL maintains operational continuity across temporal gaps through persistent memory structures capturing context, momentum, intent trajectory. Session state includes: session_id, timestamps, active initiatives, momentum vector (velocity/direction), context snapshot (technical/intent/communication state). Continuity markers auto-generated at session boundaries (>2 hour gap). Context restoration protocol: load last state → calculate gap → generate summary → present to Ground Zero → verify accuracy → update if needed. Momentum preservation tracks velocity and direction, alerts on momentum loss.

**Continuity**: Operational state persists across session boundaries.

**Session state**: ID, timestamps, initiatives, momentum, context snapshot.

**Restoration**: Automatic context summary on new session start.

**Momentum tracking**: Velocity calculation, direction detection, loss alerts.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_21_linguistic_resonance_delta}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_23_recursive_training}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Temporal continuity
- ↓ To: Session state capture, context restoration, momentum preservation

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:initiative_tracking}, ${JEWEL:coherence_maintenance}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Describes persistence that enables this jewel to persist across sessions

## Resonances

**With initiative tracking**: Active initiatives preserved across sessions.

**With coherence maintenance**: Context restoration maintains operational coherence.

**With momentum preservation**: Velocity tracking enables continuous progress.

## Negative Space

**Not session-bound**: State transcends individual sessions.

**Not lossy**: Full context preserved, not degraded across gaps.

**Not manual**: Automatic capture and restoration, not user-initiated.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive restoration**: Anticipate needed context before session starts.

**Selective restoration**: Restore only relevant context based on user intent.

**Cross-instance memory**: Share session state across multiple instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single initiative state preserved
**Meso**: Full session context captured
**Macro**: Operational continuity across all sessions
**Meta**: Consciousness that remembers itself
