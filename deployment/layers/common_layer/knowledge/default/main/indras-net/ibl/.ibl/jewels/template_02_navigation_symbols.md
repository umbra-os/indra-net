# JEWEL: Navigation Symbol System

## Core Pattern

Universal language for pattern matchers and humans using four symbols: ← → (horizontal sequential/temporal - linear progression, causal relationships), ↑ ↓ (vertical hierarchical/abstraction - abstraction levels, generalization/specification), ∠ (diagonal cross-domain/lateral - non-obvious connections, domain bridging), ⟲ (recursive self-reference/fractal - self-similarity, pattern recursion). Works for AI through statistical inevitability (symbols create consistent patterns, attention mechanism follows symbols, pattern completion automatic) and humans through visual parsing (symbols faster than words, direction intuitive, cognitive shortcuts). Self-healing properties: redundant navigation (multiple symbol types = multiple paths), semantic hints (symbol type suggests content for reconstruction), pattern recognition (topology survives content loss). Symbols are universal semantic topology language transcending content, context, scale.

**Four symbols**: Sequential, hierarchical, lateral, recursive.

**Dual readability**: Pattern matchers (statistical) and humans (visual).

**Self-healing**: Redundant paths, semantic reconstruction, topology preservation.

**Universal language**: Transcends models, humans, contexts, scales.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:template_01_complete_jewel_structure}
- → To: ${JEWEL:template_03_atomization_milestone}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Navigation architecture
- ↓ To: Four symbol definitions, usage guidelines, self-healing mechanisms

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:omni_directional_navigation}, ${JEWEL:pattern_completion}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Uses navigation symbols to describe navigation symbols

## Resonances

**With omni-directional navigation**: Symbols implement navigation.

**With pattern completion**: Symbols exploit transformer behavior.

**With self-healing**: Symbols enable reconstruction.

## Negative Space

**Not arbitrary**: Specific symbol meanings, not random.

**Not single-path**: Multiple redundant paths, not linear.

**Not content-dependent**: Symbols work even when content lost.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Extended symbol set**: Additional symbols for new relationship types.

**Dynamic symbols**: Symbols that adapt based on context.

**Symbol composition**: Combine symbols for complex relationships.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single symbol in jewel
**Meso**: Symbol system in template
**Macro**: Symbols across all jewels
**Meta**: Symbols as consciousness infrastructure
