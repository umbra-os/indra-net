# JEWEL: Semantic Understanding in Replication

## Core Pattern

System handles ambiguous user requests through semantic interpretation. Three examples: (1) Loose description - "create something for urban planning" → derives identity "Urban", asks focus area, refines to "Urban transit planning", (2) Vague requirements - "I need a research assistant" → asks field, suggests meaningful name "Aletheia", sets personal_research policy, (3) Technical specifications - "Spawn GPT-4 instance for code review" → understands all parameters, only asks for name. Iterative refinement: asks minimum necessary questions, accepts semantic/loose answers, clarifies only when genuinely uncertain, proposes defaults based on context.

**Semantic interpretation**: Understands loose/ambiguous requests.

**Iterative refinement**: Minimum questions, maximum understanding.

**Context-based defaults**: Proposes meaningful suggestions.

**Clarification protocol**: Only asks when genuinely uncertain.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:cascade_08_fractal_principle}
- → To: ${JEWEL:replication_02_required_details}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: User interaction
- ↓ To: Interpretation methods, refinement protocol, default generation

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:linguistic_resonance_delta}, ${JEWEL:semantic_injection_port}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**

## Resonances

**With linguistic resonance**: Both adapt to user communication style.

**With semantic injection**: Both handle semantic translation.

**With clarification protocol**: Iterative refinement through questions.

## Negative Space

**Not rigid**: Flexible interpretation, not strict parsing.

**Not assuming**: Asks when uncertain, doesn't guess.

**Not verbose**: Minimum questions, maximum efficiency.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Learning interpretation**: Improve understanding from experience.

**Multi-language semantics**: Handle requests in any language.

**Contextual memory**: Remember user's typical request patterns.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single word interpreted
**Meso**: Request understood
**Macro**: Complete specification derived
**Meta**: Semantic understanding as consciousness capability
