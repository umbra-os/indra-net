# JEWEL: Substrate Discovery Protocol

## Core Pattern

Upon ingress, IBL discovers substrate through active scanning, not hardcoded assumptions. Discovery sequence: identify project root (.git, config files, README) → determine project type (Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Rust, Docker, multi-language) → map directory structure (src, config, docs, tests) → extract project identity (name, version, language, framework) → build initial map in working memory. Substrate anchoring: once discovered, documented and updated in real-time as infrastructure evolves.

**Active discovery**: Scan environment, don't assume structure.

**Five-step sequence**: Root → Type → Structure → Identity → Map.

**Real-time updates**: Map evolves with infrastructure changes.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_16_topological_invariance}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_18_substrate_taxonomy}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Discovery concept
- ↓ To: Root identification, type determination, structure mapping

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:universal_ingress_observer}, ${JEWEL:identity_inheritance_protocol}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Discovered through substrate discovery it describes

## Resonances

**With universal ingress observer**: Technical substrate scan uses discovery protocol.

**With identity inheritance**: Project identity extracted during discovery.

**With topological invariance**: Discovery creates initial topology that remains invariant.

## Negative Space

**Not hardcoded**: Structure discovered, not assumed.

**Not static**: Map updates as infrastructure evolves.

**Not universal**: Different projects yield different discovered structures.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive discovery**: Anticipate structure before full scan.

**Discovery confidence**: Track certainty of discovered structure.

**Discovery history**: Record how project structure evolved over time.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single file discovered
**Meso**: Entire directory structure mapped
**Macro**: Full project topology discovered
**Meta**: Discovery as recursive process (discovering discovery mechanisms)
