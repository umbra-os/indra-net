## Reading This Document

**As Complete Unit** (Composite View):
Read this index straight through - all content summarized below.

**As Individual Atoms** (Modular View):
Navigate to `./08_constraint_analysis/` - read atoms individually at ~61 lines each.

**Both views valid.** System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

## CORE FUNCTION & PROTOCOL STEPS 1-3
**→ Full Detail**: `./08_constraint_analysis/01_core_protocol_steps1_3.md`

**Core Function:** Map what can and cannot vary in solution space.

**Protocol Steps:**
1. Identify constraint types (hard, soft, context, integration)
2. Map hard constraints (physical, logical, architectural)
3. Map soft constraints (style, quality, resource)

---

## PROTOCOL STEPS 4-7 & CONSTRAINT VIOLATION
**→ Full Detail**: `./08_constraint_analysis/02_protocol_steps4_7_violation.md`

**Protocol Steps:**
4. Map context constraints (environmental, temporal)
5. Map integration constraints (compatibility, interface)
6. Identify constraint interactions (reinforcing, conflicting, cascading)
7. Determine constraint priority (critical, important, desirable)

**Constraint Violation Analysis:**
- Hard constraints: Never violate
- Soft constraints: With justification
- Context constraints: When context changes
- Integration constraints: With coordination

## CONSTRAINT-DRIVEN DESIGN & SATISFACTION STRATEGIES
**→ Full Detail**: `./08_constraint_analysis/03_constraint_driven_design_strategies.md`

**Constraint-Driven Design:**
- Positive constraints (what must be included)
- Negative constraints (what must be excluded)
- Boundary constraints (what defines limits)

**Satisfaction Strategies:**
- Satisfy all constraints (ideal solution)
- Trade-off optimization (when constraints conflict)
- Constraint relaxation (when no solution exists)
- Zero-point derivation (when constraints too restrictive)

---

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLES & INTEGRATION
**→ Full Detail**: `./08_constraint_analysis/04_examples_integration.md`

**Examples:**
- Jewel creation (50-70 lines, parameterized, aesthetically pleasing)
- Template deployment (harmonic numbers, attention bias)
- Recursive termination (must terminate, explore thoroughly)

**Integration:**
- Feeds into: Parameterization, synthesis, deployment, resources
- Receives from: Pattern recognition, question frameworks
- Coordinates with: All meta-frameworks (universal)

## META-RECOGNITION & CONCLUSION
**→ Full Detail**: `./08_constraint_analysis/05_meta_recognition.md`

**Meta-Recognition:**
- This template has constraints (structure, content, integration, format)
- Demonstrates constraint analysis by having constraints
- Self-referential validation

**Fundamental Insight:**
- Constraints are not limitations - they're guides
- Enable creativity by defining boundaries
- Bounded solution space is manageable

## META-NOTE: MODULAR INDEX PATTERN

**Meta-Framework 08 Constraint Analysis now atomized** - protocol for mapping limits and boundaries in solution space distributed into high-resonance atoms.

**Pattern established**: This modular index presents as complete document (composite view) while pointing to 5 distributed atoms (modular view). System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

**No resonant decay**: Each atom ~61 lines, high salience throughout, full coherence maintained through index.

**Constraints are not limitations - they're guides.**
