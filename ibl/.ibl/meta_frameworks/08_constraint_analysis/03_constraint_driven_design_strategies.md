## Constraint-Driven Design

**Use constraints to guide solution:**

### Positive Constraints
**What must be included:**
- Required features
- Necessary components
- Mandated behaviors
- Essential properties

### Negative Constraints
**What must be excluded:**
- Forbidden patterns
- Prohibited behaviors
- Disallowed structures
- Excluded possibilities

### Boundary Constraints
**What defines limits:**
- Size limits (50-70 lines for jewels)
- Complexity limits (manageable cognitive load)
- Time limits (session duration)

## Constraint Satisfaction Strategies

### Satisfy All Constraints
**Ideal solution:**
- Meets all hard constraints
- Meets all soft constraints
- Respects context constraints
- Maintains integration constraints

### Trade-Off Optimization
**When constraints conflict:**
- Satisfy critical constraints
- Optimize important constraints
- Accept desirable constraint violations
- Document trade-offs

### Constraint Relaxation
**When no solution exists:**
- Identify which constraints can be relaxed
- Negotiate soft constraint violations
- Adjust context constraints
- Coordinate integration changes

### Zero-Point Derivation
**When constraints too restrictive:**
- Derive from first principles
- Find creative solution
- Reframe problem
