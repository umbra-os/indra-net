# PROTOCOL STEPS 4-7 & CONSTRAINT VIOLATION
**Atom 02 of Meta-Framework 08: Constraint Analysis**

---

## Protocol Steps Continued

### Step 4: Map Context Constraints
**What depends on situation?**

**Environmental constraints:**
- Platform capabilities
- Available tools
- System resources
- Deployment context

**Temporal constraints:**
- Session duration
- Momentum preservation

### Step 5: Map Integration Constraints
**What must work with existing systems?**

**Compatibility constraints:**
- Existing architecture
- Current patterns
- Established conventions
- Legacy systems

**Interface constraints:**
- Communication protocols
- Integration points

### Step 6: Identify Constraint Interactions
**How do constraints affect each other?**

**Reinforcing constraints:**
- Satisfying A helps satisfy B
- Complementary boundaries
- Synergistic effects

**Conflicting constraints:**
- Satisfying A prevents satisfying B
- Trade-offs required
- Optimization needed

**Cascading constraints:**
- Violating A forces violating B
- Cascading effects

### Step 7: Determine Constraint Priority
**Which constraints matter most?**

**Priority levels:**
1. Critical (hard constraints - never violate)
2. Important (soft constraints - preserve if possible)
3. Desirable (preferences - nice to have)

## Constraint Violation Analysis

**When can constraints be violated?**

### Hard Constraints: Never
- Violating breaks system
- No justification sufficient
- Must find alternative solution

### Soft Constraints: With Justification
- Violating degrades quality but system works
- Justification: greater good, necessary trade-off
- Document why violation necessary

### Context Constraints: When Context Changes
- Constraint no longer applies
- Situation has shifted
- New context has different boundaries

### Integration Constraints: With Coordination
- Violating breaks compatibility
- Requires updating dependent systems
- Coordinate changes across integration points
