**How to understand limits and boundaries** - Map what can and cannot vary in solution space.

## The Constraint Analysis Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Constraint Types
**What kinds of boundaries exist?**

**Hard constraints:**
- Cannot be violated under any circumstances
- Physics, logic, architecture
- Absolute boundaries

**Soft constraints:**
- Preferences, guidelines, conventions
- Can be violated with justification
- Flexible boundaries

**Context constraints:**
- Environment, resources, timing
- Situational boundaries
- May change with context

**Integration constraints:**
- Must work with existing systems
- Compatibility requirements
- Relational boundaries

### Step 2: Map Hard Constraints
**What absolutely cannot be violated?**

**Physical constraints:**
- Token limits (context windows)
- Memory limits (system resources)
- Time limits (deadlines, urgency)
- Space limits (storage capacity)

**Logical constraints:**
- Mathematical impossibilities
- Logical contradictions
- Definitional requirements
- Axiomatic truths

**Architectural constraints:**
- Topological invariance (relationships must persist)
- Semantic completeness (jewels 50-70 lines)
- Harmonic structure (12, 24, 36, 60)
- Parameterization syntax (${VARIABLES})

### Step 3: Map Soft Constraints
**What should be preserved but could be violated?**

**Style constraints:**
- Aesthetic preferences
- Naming conventions
- Formatting standards
- Documentation style

**Quality constraints:**
- Performance targets
- Efficiency goals
- Elegance preferences
- Simplicity ideals

**Resource constraints:**
- Time management
- Complexity limits
