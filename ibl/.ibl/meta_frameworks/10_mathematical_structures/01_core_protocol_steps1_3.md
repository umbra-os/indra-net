## The Mathematical Structures Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Applicable Structures
**What mathematical patterns fit this problem?**

**Geometric structures:**
- Points, lines, planes, spaces
- Triangles, tetrahedra, octants, hypercubes
- Fractals, spirals, networks
- Topologies, manifolds, transformations

**Algebraic structures:**
- Groups, rings, fields
- Vector spaces, matrices
- Operations, transformations
- Symmetries, invariants

**Harmonic structures:**
- Frequencies, overtones, resonance
- Fibonacci sequence, golden ratio
- Prime factorizations, harmonic numbers
- Wave patterns, interference

**Logical structures:**
- Boolean algebra, propositional logic
- Set theory, category theory
- Type systems, formal systems
- Proof structures, inference rules

### Step 2: Map Problem to Structure
**How does problem map onto mathematical pattern?**

**Identify correspondences:**
- Problem elements → Mathematical objects
- Problem relationships → Mathematical operations
- Problem constraints → Mathematical properties
- Problem goals → Mathematical solutions

**Example:**
- Decision space → 8-octant geometric space
- Binary choices → 3 axes (Known/Unknown, etc.)
- Navigation → Geometric movement
- Solution → Point in space

### Step 3: Apply Mathematical Properties
**What does mathematics tell us?**

**Geometric properties:**
- Symmetries (what's invariant under transformation?)
- Distances (how far between states?)
- Paths (what routes exist?)
- Boundaries (what are limits?)

**Algebraic properties:**
- Operations (what can be combined?)
- Inverses (what can be undone?)
- Identities (what leaves things unchanged?)
- Homomorphisms (what preserves structure?)

**Harmonic properties:**
- Resonances (what amplifies?)
- Frequencies (what repeats?)
- Overtones (what emerges?)
- Interference (what combines?)
