## Mathematical Design Patterns

### Symmetry Pattern
**Invariance under transformation:**
- Rotational symmetry (looks same after rotation)
- Translational symmetry (looks same after shift)
- Reflectional symmetry (looks same after mirror)

**When to use:**
- Need transformation invariance
- Desire aesthetic harmony

### Duality Pattern
**Two perspectives on same structure:**
- Vertices ↔ Faces (tetrahedral duality)
- Top-down ↔ Bottom-up (bidirectional derivation)
- Problem ↔ Solution (complementary views)

**When to use:**
- Need multiple perspectives
- Desire completeness

### Recursion Pattern
**Structure contains itself:**
- Fractals (patterns within patterns)
- Meta-frameworks (templates for templates)
- Self-reference (system observing itself)

**When to use:**
- Need scale independence
- Desire self-application

### Optimization Pattern
**Minimize/maximize objective:**
- Minimize complexity
- Maximize coherence
- Optimize efficiency

**When to use:**
- Need optimal solution
- Desire efficiency
