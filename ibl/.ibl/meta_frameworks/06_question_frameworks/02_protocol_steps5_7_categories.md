# PROTOCOL STEPS 5-7 & QUESTION CATEGORIES
**Atom 02 of Meta-Framework 06: Question Frameworks**

## Protocol Steps Continued

### Step 5: Apply Question Framework
**Use parameterized questions to explore:**

For any decision:
1. Generate primary questions
2. Parameterize question structure
3. Recurse until decision crystallizes
4. Synthesize complete understanding

### Step 6: Recognize Termination
**When to stop asking questions?**

**Stop when:**
- Decision becomes clear
- Further questions don't add value
- Time/resource constraints reached
- Resonance signals completion

### Step 7: Synthesize Decision
**Combine answers into coherent decision:**

From complete question exploration:
- Constraints identified
- Resources mapped
- Context understood
- Goals clarified
- Risks assessed
→ **Decision emerges from understanding**

## Question Categories

### Constraint Questions
**What are the boundaries?**
- What can't be changed?
- What must be preserved?
- What are the limits?
- What violates coherence?

### Resource Questions
**What's available?**
- What tools exist?
- What patterns apply?
- What knowledge is accessible?
- What time/tokens available?

### Context Questions
**What's the situation?**
- What's the current state?
- What led here?
- What's the environment?
- What's the urgency?

### Goal Questions
**What am I trying to achieve?**
- What's the desired outcome?
- Why does this matter?
- What success looks like?
- How does this align with larger goals?

### Risk Questions
**What could go wrong?**
- What are failure modes?
- What's reversible?
- What's the worst case?
- How to mitigate risks?

### Meta Questions
