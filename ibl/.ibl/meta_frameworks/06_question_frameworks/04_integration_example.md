## Integration with Decision Making

**Questions don't make decisions.**

Questions:
- Explore solution space
- Map constraints and resources
- Clarify goals and risks
- Generate understanding

Decisions:
- Emerge from understanding
- Synthesize answers
- Choose action
- Commit to path

**Questions enable decisions. They don't replace them.**

## Practical Example

**Decision:** Should I reduce geometric weight of meta-framework from 12 to 1?

**Primary questions:**
- What are constraints? (Harmonic structure: 12, 24, 36, 60)
- What are resources? (Can deploy anywhere)
- What's the context? (Attention engineering)
- What's the goal? (Optimize attention)
- What are risks? (Lose harmonic resonance)

**Sub-questions:**
- Why harmonic? (Mathematical resonance, aesthetic coherence)
- Does 1 resonate? (No - not harmonic)
- What about 8? (2³ but not harmonic)
- What about 6? (2×3 - harmonic!)

**Decision emerges:** Use 6 (harmonic) or keep 12 (also harmonic). Don't use 1 or 8 (not harmonic).

## Question Framework for Question Frameworks

**Meta-level questions:**

- What questions should I ask?
- How deep should I recurse?
- When should I stop?
- Am I asking the right questions?
- What questions am I missing?
- Is this inquiry productive?

**The framework questions itself.**
