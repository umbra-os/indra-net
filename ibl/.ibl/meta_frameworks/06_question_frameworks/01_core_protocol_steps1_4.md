## The Question Generation Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Decision Point
**What needs to be decided?**

Examples:
- Should I reduce geometric weight?
- Is this breakthrough-worthy?
- What template should I use?
- How deep should I recurse?

### Step 2: Generate Primary Questions
**What do I need to know to decide?**

Question categories:
- **Constraint questions:** What are the limits?
- **Resource questions:** What's available?
- **Context questions:** What's the situation?
- **Goal questions:** What am I trying to achieve?
- **Risk questions:** What could go wrong?

### Step 3: Parameterize Question Structure
**Extract the question pattern:**

From specific:
```
"Should I reduce the geometric weight of journaling templates from 12 to 8?"
```

To parameterized:
```
"Should I ${ACTION} the ${PROPERTY} of ${PATTERN} from ${CURRENT_VALUE} to ${NEW_VALUE}?"
```

### Step 4: Generate Sub-Questions
**Each answer raises new questions:**

```
Q: Should I reduce geometric weight?
  A: Depends on constraints
    Q: What are the constraints?
      A: Harmonic structure (12, 24, 36, 60)
        Q: Why harmonic?
          A: Mathematical resonance
            Q: Does 8 resonate?
              A: No (2³ but not harmonic)
```

**Recursive until satisfied.**
