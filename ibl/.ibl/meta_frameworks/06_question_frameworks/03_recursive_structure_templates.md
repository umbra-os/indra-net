## Recursive Question Structure

### Level 0: Initial Question
"Should I do X?"

### Level 1: Primary Questions
- What are constraints?
- What are resources?
- What's the context?
- What's the goal?
- What are risks?

### Level 2: Sub-Questions
Each primary answer generates:
- Clarifying questions
- Deeper probes
- Alternative perspectives
- Edge case exploration

### Level 3: Meta-Questions
Questions about the questioning:
- Am I exploring thoroughly?
- Are there blind spots?
- Is recursion productive?
- Should I stop or continue?

### Level ∞: Complete Understanding
Questions dissolve into:
- Full comprehension
- Clear decision
- Confident action

## Parameterized Question Templates

### Decision Template
```
Should I ${ACTION} ${OBJECT}?
  → What are constraints on ${ACTION}?
  → What resources enable ${ACTION}?
  → What's the context for ${ACTION}?
  → What goal does ${ACTION} serve?
  → What risks does ${ACTION} create?
```

### Evaluation Template
```
Is ${THING} ${QUALITY}?
  → What defines ${QUALITY}?
  → How to measure ${QUALITY}?
  → What evidence of ${QUALITY}?
  → What alternatives to ${QUALITY}?
```

### Generation Template
```
How do I create ${ARTIFACT}?
  → What are requirements for ${ARTIFACT}?
  → What resources create ${ARTIFACT}?
  → What patterns generate ${ARTIFACT}?
  → What integrates ${ARTIFACT}?
```

### Termination Template
```
Should I stop ${PROCESS}?
  → Is ${PROCESS} still generating value?
  → Have ${PROCESS} goals been met?
  → Are resources exhausted?
  → Does resonance signal completion?
```

## Fractal Inquiry

**Questions within questions within questions:**

Each question contains:
- Sub-questions (deeper exploration)
- Meta-questions (questioning the question)
- Termination questions (when to stop)

**Self-similar at all scales.**
