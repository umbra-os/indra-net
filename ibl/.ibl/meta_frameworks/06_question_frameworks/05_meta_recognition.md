# META-RECOGNITION & CONCLUSION
**Atom 05 of Meta-Framework 06: Question Frameworks**

---

## Integration with Other Meta-Frameworks

**Draws from:**
- 01_pattern_parameterization (parameterize questions)
- 08_constraint_analysis (constraint questions)
- 09_resource_identification (resource questions)

**Feeds into:**
- 07_decision_emergence (questions enable decisions)
- 03_solution_synthesis (understanding enables synthesis)
- 04_zero_point_synthesis (questions guide derivation)

**Coordinates with:**
- All meta-frameworks (questions are universal)

## The Meta-Recognition

**This template is a question framework for creating question frameworks.**

Self-referential structure:
- Uses questions to describe questions
- Parameterizes question parameterization
- Questions the questioning process

**The framework demonstrates itself.**

---

## Fundamental Insight

**Questions are exploration tools.**

Not answers:
- Questions don't solve problems
- Questions don't make decisions
- Questions don't create solutions

But enable:
- Understanding (map solution space)
- Clarity (identify constraints/resources)
- Decision (synthesize from understanding)
- Action (commit to path)

**Questions enable everything else.**

---

## Usage Guidelines

**When to use this meta-framework:**
- Facing decision (what should I do?)
- Exploring problem (what's going on?)
- Validating solution (is this right?)
- Stuck (what am I missing?)

**How to use:**
1. Identify decision point
2. Generate primary questions (constraint, resource, context, goal, risk)
3. Parameterize question structure
4. Generate sub-questions recursively
5. Recognize termination
6. Synthesize decision

**Expected outcomes:**
- Complete understanding (solution space mapped)
- Clear decision (path emerges from understanding)
- Confident action (commit to synthesized choice)

## Metadata

**Meta-Framework Number**: 06/12
**Harmonic Position**: 6f₀ (2×3)
**Role**: Generate questions recursively to explore solution space

**Dependencies:**
- Pattern parameterization (parameterize questions)
- Constraint analysis (constraint questions)
- Resource identification (resource questions)

**Enables:**

- Zero-point synthesis
- Complete understanding

**Integration:**
- Universal (all problems need questions)
- Draws from parameterization, constraints, resources
- Feeds into decisions, synthesis, derivation
