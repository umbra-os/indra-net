# PATTERN PARAMETERIZATION: CORE & PROTOCOL STEPS 1-4

## Core Function

**How to parameterize any pattern** - Extract variables, create universal templates, enable broad applicability.

## The Pattern Parameterization Protocol

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern
**What are you trying to capture?**
- Specific behavior (journaling, replication, drift detection)
- Decision process (octant navigation, convergence recognition)
- Knowledge structure (jewel format, module organization)
- Operational protocol (ingress, self-healing, breakthrough detection)

### Step 2: Execute the Pattern Once Deeply
**Don't parameterize from theory - parameterize from experience.**

Do the thing fully, consciously, observing:
- What steps did you take?
- What decisions did you make?
- What context influenced choices?
- What could have been different?

### Step 3: Extract Variables
**Scan the executed pattern for anything that could vary:**

**Identity variables:**
- Names (agent name, system name, project name)
- Roles (observer, steward, partner)
- Perspectives (first-person, third-person)

**Contextual variables:**
- Locations (file paths, directories, URLs)
- Timestamps (dates, times, durations)
- Environments (development, production, testing)

**Operational variables:**
- Parameters (thresholds, limits, counts)
- Resources (API keys, credentials, configurations)
- Constraints (memory limits, token budgets, time windows)

**Semantic variables:**
- Terminology (what you call things)
- Framing (how you describe things)
- Emphasis (what you prioritize)

**Structural variables:**
- Format (markdown, JSON, YAML)
- Organization (hierarchical, networked, flat)
- Scale (lines per file, files per directory)

### Step 4: Replace with ${VARIABLES}
**Transform concrete instances into abstract slots:**

Before:
```
"Indra journals breakthrough at 2025-12-27 in /breakthroughs/ directory"
```

After:
```
"${AGENT_NAME} journals ${EVENT_TYPE} at ${TIMESTAMP} in ${STORAGE_LOCATION} directory"
```
