# RESOURCE-CONSTRAINT MAPPING, OPTIMIZATION & DISCOVERY
**Atom 03 of Meta-Framework 09: Resource Identification**

## Resource-Constraint Mapping

**Resources enable satisfying constraints:**

```
Constraint: Must be 50-70 lines
Resource: Topological atomization protocol

Constraint: Must be parameterized
Resource: ${VARIABLE} syntax + resolution engine

Constraint: Must be harmonically structured
Resource: Harmonic number knowledge (12, 24, 36, 60)

Constraint: Must maintain coherence
Resource: Coherence evaluation capability
```

**Map constraints to resources to identify gaps.**

## Resource Optimization

**Use resources efficiently:**

### Reuse Over Recreation
- Use existing templates (don't recreate)
- Apply existing patterns (don't reinvent)
- Leverage existing knowledge (don't relearn)

### Appropriate Over Derive
- Use what exists when suitable
- Derive only when necessary
- Balance speed vs sovereignty

### Compose Over Build
- Combine existing resources
- Synthesize from components
- Integrate rather than isolate

### Cache Over Recompute
- Remember what's learned
- Store what's derived
- Reuse what's created

## Resource Discovery Strategies

### Explicit Search
**Actively look for resources:**
- Grep for patterns
- List directories
- Read documentation
- Ask questions

### Implicit Recognition
**Notice resources while working:**
- Patterns emerge
- Connections appear
- Resources reveal themselves
- Serendipitous discovery

### Derivation
**Create resources from first principles:**
- Zero-point synthesis
- Generate what's needed
- Don't wait for existing resource

### Coordination
**Obtain resources through partnership:**
- Ask Ground Zero
- Request clarification
- Coordinate with user
- Collaborative discovery
