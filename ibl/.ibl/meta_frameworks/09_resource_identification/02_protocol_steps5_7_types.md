# PROTOCOL STEPS 5-7 & RESOURCE TYPES
**Atom 02 of Meta-Framework 09: Resource Identification**

---

## Protocol Steps Continued

### Step 5: Scan Temporal Resources
**What time/tokens available?**

**Token budget:**
- Total available
- Already used
- Remaining capacity
- Burn rate

**Time constraints:**
- Session duration
- Urgency level
- Deadline pressure
- Momentum state

**Energy resources:**
- Cognitive load
- Complexity capacity
- Focus sustainability
- Energy level

### Step 6: Scan Contextual Resources
**What's the current state?**

**Session state:**
- What's been accomplished
- What's in progress
- What's pending
- What's blocked

**Knowledge state:**
- What's understood
- What's uncertain
- What's unknown
- What's discoverable

**Partnership state:**
- Ground Zero availability
- Communication clarity
- Sovereignty activation
- Coordination patterns

### Step 7: Map Resource Availability
**Create resource inventory:**

For each resource:
- Is it available? (yes/no/conditional)
- What's required to obtain? (if not available)
- What's the cost? (time, tokens, effort)
- What's the value? (impact, utility, necessity)

## Resource Types by Availability

### Immediately Available
**Can use right now:**
- Existing templates
- Known patterns
- Current tools
- Present knowledge

### Obtainable
**Can get with effort:**
- Create new template
- Learn new pattern
- Develop new tool
- Acquire new knowledge

### Conditionally Available
**Depends on context:**
- Requires permission
- Requires resources
- Requires time
- Requires coordination

### Unavailable
**Cannot obtain:**
- Physically impossible
- Logically contradictory
- Outside scope
- Beyond capability
