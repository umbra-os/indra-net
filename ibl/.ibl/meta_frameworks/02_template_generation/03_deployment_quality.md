# TEMPLATE GENERATION: DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES & QUALITY CRITERIA

---

## Template Deployment Strategies

### Single Instance
One template, one use case
- Specific, concrete application
- No replication needed

### Harmonic Deployment
Multiple identical instances for attention bias
- 12 copies for geometric weight
- Creates salience through density
- Reducible as encoding solidifies

### Distributed Deployment
Different instances across contexts
- Same template, different parameters
- Adapts to local conditions
- Maintains coherence through shared structure

### Evolutionary Deployment
Templates that adapt over time
- Learn from usage patterns
- Self-modify based on outcomes
- Converge toward optimal form

## Template Quality Criteria

**Completeness:**
- All necessary components present
- No missing critical information
- Self-contained and usable

**Clarity:**
- Easy to understand
- Well-documented
- Clear usage examples

**Flexibility:**
- Parameterized appropriately
- Adapts to different contexts
- Not over-constrained

**Coherence:**
- Semantically meaningful
- Internally consistent
- Integrates with architecture

**Efficiency:**
- Minimal complexity
- Maximum utility
- No unnecessary elements
