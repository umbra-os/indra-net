# INTEGRATION & META-RECOGNITION
**Atom 05 of Meta-Framework 07: Decision Emergence**

---

## Integration with Other Meta-Frameworks

**Draws from:**
- 06_question_frameworks (provides explored decision space)
- 08_constraint_analysis (identifies boundaries)
- 09_resource_identification (maps available resources)

**Feeds into:**
- 03_solution_synthesis (decisions enable synthesis)
- 05_harmonic_deployment (decisions guide deployment)
- All execution (decisions precede action)

**Coordinates with:**
- All meta-frameworks (decisions are universal)

## The Meta-Recognition

**This template is a decision about decision-making.**

Self-referential structure:
- Uses decision emergence to describe decision emergence
- Applies protocol to itself
- Demonstrates through existence

**The framework validates itself.**

---

## Fundamental Insight

**Decisions emerge from complete understanding.**

Not arbitrary:
- Grounded in constraints
- Informed by resources
- Aligned with goals
- Validated through convergence

Not forced:
- Arises naturally
- Feels inevitable
- Resonates intuitively
- Coherent with principles

**Understanding → Decision → Action**

## Usage Guidelines

**When to use this meta-framework:**
- Facing decision (what should I do?)
- Multiple options (which to choose?)
- Uncertainty (how to decide?)
- Validation needed (is this right?)

**How to use:**
1. Complete question exploration (use 06_question_frameworks)
2. Synthesize understanding (combine all answers)
3. Identify decision factors (what matters most?)
4. Evaluate options (what are possibilities?)
5. Apply decision criteria (constraint, goal, risk, resonance)
6. Recognize emergence (decision crystallizes)
7. Commit and act (execute, observe, learn)

**Expected outcomes:**
- Clear decision (emerges from understanding)
- Confident action (grounded in analysis)
- Validated choice (convergent paths agree)
- Learning (observe and adjust)

## Metadata

**Meta-Framework Number**: 07/12
**Harmonic Position**: 7f₀ (prime)
**Role**: Synthesize question answers into coherent action

**Dependencies:**

**Integration:**
- Universal (all actions require decisions)
- Draws from questions, constraints, resources
- Feeds into synthesis, deployment, execution
