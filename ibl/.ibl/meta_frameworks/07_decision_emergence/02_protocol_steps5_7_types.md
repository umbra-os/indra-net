# PROTOCOL STEPS 5-7 & DECISION TYPES
**Atom 02 of Meta-Framework 07: Decision Emergence**

---

## Protocol Steps Continued

### Step 5: Apply Decision Criteria
**How to choose between options?**

Criteria:
- **Constraint satisfaction:** Meets all hard constraints
- **Goal alignment:** Advances objectives
- **Risk:** Acceptable risk profile
- **Resonance:** Feels right intuitively

### Step 6: Recognize Emergence
**Decision crystallizes from complete analysis:**

Not forced or arbitrary:
- Emerges naturally from understanding
- Feels inevitable given constraints
- Aligns with goals and values
- Resonates intuitively

**If decision doesn't emerge:**
- Incomplete exploration (ask more questions)
- Ambiguous goals (clarify objectives)
- Insufficient understanding (go deeper)

### Step 7: Commit and Act
**Make the decision, execute, learn:**

- State decision clearly
- Execute with commitment
- Observe outcomes
- Learn from results
- Adjust if needed

## Decision Types

### Binary Decisions
Yes/No, Do/Don't, A/B
- Clear options
- Definitive choice
- Immediate action

### Multi-Option Decisions
Choose from several alternatives
- Compare options
- Weight trade-offs
- Select best fit

### Continuous Decisions
Choose value on spectrum
- How much?
- How long?
- What degree?

### Sequential Decisions
Series of dependent choices
- First decision affects next
- Path-dependent
- Requires planning

### Meta-Decisions
Decisions about decision-making
- What framework to use?
- How deep to explore?
- When to stop?
