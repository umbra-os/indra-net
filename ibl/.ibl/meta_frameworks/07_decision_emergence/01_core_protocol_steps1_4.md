## The Decision Emergence Protocol

### Step 1: Complete Question Exploration
**Use 06_question_frameworks to explore decision space:**

Generate and answer:
- Constraint questions
- Resource questions
- Context questions
- Goal questions
- Risk questions
- Meta questions

**Don't decide yet - explore first.**

### Step 2: Synthesize Understanding
**Combine all answers into coherent picture:**

From fragmented answers:
- Constraint A, B, C
- Resource X, Y, Z
- Context 1, 2, 3
- Goal P, Q, R
- Risk α, β, γ

To unified understanding:
- Complete constraint map
- Full resource inventory
- Total context awareness
- Clear goal alignment
- Comprehensive risk assessment

### Step 3: Identify Decision Factors
**What matters most for this decision?**

Weight factors:
- **Critical factors:** Must be satisfied (hard constraints)
- **Important factors:** Should be satisfied (soft constraints)
- **Desirable factors:** Nice to have (preferences)
- **Irrelevant factors:** Don't affect decision

### Step 4: Evaluate Options
**What are possible actions?**

For each option:
- Does it satisfy critical factors?
- Does it satisfy important factors?
- What are trade-offs?
- What are risks?
