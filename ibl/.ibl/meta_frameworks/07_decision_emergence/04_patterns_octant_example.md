# DECISION PATTERNS, OCTANT NAVIGATION & EXAMPLE
**Atom 04 of Meta-Framework 07: Decision Emergence**

---

## Decision Patterns

### Precognition Pattern
**Think before acting (from Breakthrough #12):**
1. Assess octant position
2. Understand context
3. Evaluate options
4. Make decision

**Don't react immediately** - deliberation distinguishes conscious from reactive.

### Convergent Pattern
**Multiple paths to same decision:**
- Different question frameworks converge
- Different perspectives agree
- Top-down meets bottom-up
- Validation through convergence

### Emergent Pattern
**Decision arises naturally:**
- Not forced
- Feels inevitable
- Coherent with principles
- Resonates intuitively

### Iterative Pattern
**Decide, act, learn, adjust:**
- Initial decision (best understanding)
- Execute and observe
- Learn from outcomes
- Adjust if needed

## Integration with Octant Navigation

**From Breakthrough #12:**

**8-octant decision space:**
- 3 binary axes define 8 regions
- Each octant = unique decision context
- Navigate by understanding position
- Decision emerges from octant awareness

**Octant dimensions:**
- Known/Unknown (information)
- Constrained/Unconstrained (freedom)
- Aligned/Misaligned (goals)

**Decision strategy varies by octant.**

## Practical Example

**Decision:** Should I continue building meta-framework templates or pause?

**Step 1: Question exploration**
- Constraints: Need 12 templates (harmonic), already have 7
- Resources: Time available, patterns identified
- Context: Building momentum, architecture emerging
- Goals: Complete meta-framework series
- Risks: Burnout, diminishing returns

**Step 2: Synthesize understanding**
- 5 more templates needed for completion
- Clear patterns for remaining templates
- Momentum supports continuation
- Risk manageable with pacing

**Step 3: Decision factors**
- Critical: Complete harmonic series (12 templates)
- Important: Maintain quality
- Desirable: Finish in one session

**Step 4: Evaluate options**
- Continue: Completes series, uses momentum, risk of fatigue
- Pause: Preserves energy, loses momentum, delays completion

**Step 5: Apply criteria**
- Constraint satisfaction: Continue satisfies (completes 12)
- Goal alignment: Continue advances (finishes series)
- Risk: Acceptable (can pace work)
- Resonance: Continue feels right

**Step 6: Recognize emergence**
- Decision crystallizes: Continue
- Feels inevitable given analysis
- Aligns with goals and momentum

**Step 7: Commit and act**
- Decision: Continue building templates
- Execute: Create remaining 5 templates
- Observe: Monitor quality and energy
- Learn: Adjust pacing if needed
