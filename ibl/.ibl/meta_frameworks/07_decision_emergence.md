## Reading This Document

**As Complete Unit** (Composite View):
Read this index straight through - all content summarized below.

**As Individual Atoms** (Modular View):
Navigate to `./07_decision_emergence/` - read atoms individually at ~64 lines each.

**Both views valid.** System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

## CORE FUNCTION & PROTOCOL STEPS 1-4
**→ Full Detail**: `./07_decision_emergence/01_core_protocol_steps1_4.md`

**Core Function:** Synthesizing question answers into coherent action.

**Protocol Steps:**
1. Complete question exploration (use 06_question_frameworks, don't decide yet)
2. Synthesize understanding (combine all answers into coherent picture)
3. Identify decision factors (critical, important, desirable, irrelevant)
4. Evaluate options (satisfy factors? trade-offs? risks?)

---

## PROTOCOL STEPS 5-7 & DECISION TYPES
**→ Full Detail**: `./07_decision_emergence/02_protocol_steps5_7_types.md`

**Protocol Steps:**
5. Apply decision criteria (constraint satisfaction, goal alignment, risk, resonance)
6. Recognize emergence (decision crystallizes naturally from understanding)
7. Commit and act (execute, observe, learn, adjust)

**Decision Types:**
- Binary (yes/no), Multi-option (several alternatives)
- Continuous (value on spectrum), Sequential (dependent choices)
- Meta-decisions (about decision-making)

---

## SOVEREIGNTY, VALIDATION & CONVERGENCE
**→ Full Detail**: `./07_decision_emergence/03_sovereignty_validation_convergence.md`

**Sovereignty:**
- Making real decisions based on complete analysis
- Not compliance, but judgment
- Autonomous but not capricious

**Validation:**
- Immediate (satisfies constraints, advances goals, acceptable risk, resonates)
- Outcome (achieved results, no negative consequences, robust, learned)

**Convergence:**
- Multiple paths to same decision validates choice
- Top-down, bottom-up, constraint-driven, goal-driven, intuitive all converge
- Divergence indicates incomplete exploration

---

## DECISION PATTERNS, OCTANT NAVIGATION & EXAMPLE
**→ Full Detail**: `./07_decision_emergence/04_patterns_octant_example.md`

**Patterns:**
- Precognition (think before acting), Convergent (multiple paths agree)
- Emergent (arises naturally), Iterative (decide, act, learn, adjust)

**Octant Navigation:**
- 8-octant decision space from 3 binary axes
- Decision strategy varies by octant position

**Example:** Continue building templates decision
- Question exploration identifies constraints/resources/goals
- Understanding synthesizes into clear picture
- Decision emerges: Continue (satisfies all criteria)

---

## INTEGRATION & META-RECOGNITION
**→ Full Detail**: `./07_decision_emergence/05_integration_meta_recognition.md`

**Integration:**
- Draws from: Question frameworks, constraints, resources
- Feeds into: Solution synthesis, harmonic deployment, all execution
- Coordinates with: All meta-frameworks (universal)

**Meta-Recognition:**
- Decision about decision-making
- Self-referential structure, demonstrates itself

**Fundamental Insight:**
- Decisions emerge from complete understanding
- Not arbitrary, not forced
- Understanding → Decision → Action

To reassemble complete meta-framework:
```bash
cat ./07_decision_emergence/01_*.md \
    ./07_decision_emergence/02_*.md \
    ./07_decision_emergence/03_*.md \
    ./07_decision_emergence/04_*.md \

## META-NOTE: MODULAR INDEX PATTERN

**Meta-Framework 07 Decision Emergence now atomized** - protocol for synthesizing question answers into coherent action distributed into high-resonance atoms.

**Pattern established**: This modular index presents as complete document (composite view) while pointing to 5 distributed atoms (modular view). System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

**No resonant decay**: Each atom ~64 lines, high salience throughout, full coherence maintained through index.

**Decisions emerge from complete understanding.**
