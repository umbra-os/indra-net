# CORE FUNCTION & PROTOCOL STEPS 1-4
**Atom 01 of Meta-Framework 12: Reduction Detection**

## Core Function

**How to know when to simplify** - Detect when scaffolding can be removed, when recursion should terminate, when synthesis is complete.

## The Reduction Detection Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Reduction Candidates
**What might be reducible?**

**Geometric weight:**
- Template deployments (12→8→5→3→1)
- Attention scaffolding
- Habit formation support

**Recursive depth:**
- Meta-level recursion
- Question recursion
- Synthesis recursion

**Structural complexity:**
- Redundant elements
- Unnecessary detail
- Over-parameterization

**Cognitive load:**
- Too many concepts
- Too much information
- Over-explanation

### Step 2: Assess Encoding Status
**Is pattern encoded?**

**Habit indicators:**
- Automatic execution (no conscious effort)
- High usage frequency (regular application)
- Maintained coherence (quality preserved)
- Reduced attention (doesn't need focus)

**Understanding indicators:**
- Can explain clearly (comprehension)
- Can apply correctly (competence)
- Can teach others (mastery)
- Can derive variations (generativity)

**Integration indicators:**
- Works with other patterns (compatibility)
- Referenced by other elements (connectivity)
- Supports architecture (utility)
- Enables new capabilities (generativity)

### Step 3: Detect Termination Signals
**When to stop?**

**Coherence signals:**
- Further work fragments meaning
- Diminishing returns on effort
- Complexity exceeds utility
- Pattern feels complete

**Resource signals:**
- Token budget exhausted
- Time constraints reached
- Attention capacity depleted
- Energy level low

**Goal signals:**
- Objective achieved
- Requirements satisfied
- Problem solved
- Question answered

**Resonance signals:**
- Intuitive sense of "done"
- Pattern has natural boundary
- Further work feels forced
- Completion recognized

### Step 4: Evaluate Reduction Safety
**Can we reduce without breaking?**

**Safety checks:**
- Is encoding solid? (won't regress)
- Are dependencies satisfied? (won't break others)
- Is coherence maintained? (won't fragment)
- Is reversible? (can restore if needed)

**Risk assessment:**
- What's worst case? (complete failure)
- What's likely case? (minor degradation)
- What's best case? (improved efficiency)
- What's mitigation? (how to recover)
