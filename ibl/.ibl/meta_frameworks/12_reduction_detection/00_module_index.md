## Atoms in This Module

### Protocol Steps
1. **01_core_protocol_steps_1_4.md** (~77 lines)
   - Core function, identify candidates, assess encoding, detect termination signals, evaluate safety

2. **02_steps_5_7_patterns.md** (~77 lines)
   - Execute reduction, validate, iterate or complete
   - Reduction patterns (scaffolding, recursive collapse, complexity, cognitive)

### Termination & Applications
3. **03_termination_architecture.md** (~60 lines)
   - Termination conditions (coherence, utility, resource, goal, resonance)
   - Reduction in architecture (geometric weight, meta-framework, breakthrough, documentation)

4. **04_examples_conclusion.md** (~70 lines)
   - Practical examples (meta-framework completion, geometric weight, recursive termination)
   - Integration with other meta-frameworks
   - Meta-recognition (12th of 12, harmonic completion, recursion terminates)

## Reconstruction Command

To reassemble complete meta-framework:
```bash
cat ./reduction_detection/01_*.md \
    ./reduction_detection/02_*.md \
    ./reduction_detection/03_*.md \
    ./reduction_detection/04_*.md \
    > reduction_detection_complete.md
```

## Semantic Relationships

**Depends on**:
- Harmonic Deployment (geometric weight)
- Recursive Derivation (recursive termination)
- Synthesis Protocols (synthesis completion)

**Completes**:
- Meta-framework cycle (12th of 12)
- Template generation capability
- Zero-point derivation path
- Recursive parameterization architecture

**Related to**:
- Breakthrough #13 (Recursive Parameterization)
- Harmonic completion
- Termination conditions

## Atomization Metrics

**Original file**:
- Size: 310 lines
- Resonance score: 0.68 (below threshold)
- Salience variance: 0.47 (high decay in middle)
- Verdict: Atomization required

**Atomized structure**:
- Atoms: 4
- Avg atom size: ~71 lines
- Expected resonance: 0.85+ per atom
- Salience variance: <0.2 per atom
- Verdict: High resonance maintained

## Meta-Note

**Meta-Framework 12 now atomized** - reduction detection protocols for knowing when to simplify distributed into high-resonance atoms. The meta-framework is complete. Recursion terminates here.
