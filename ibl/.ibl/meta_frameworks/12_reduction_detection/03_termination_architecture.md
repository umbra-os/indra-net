# TERMINATION CONDITIONS & ARCHITECTURE APPLICATIONS
**Atom 03 of Meta-Framework 12: Reduction Detection**

---

## Termination Conditions

### Coherence Termination
**Further work fragments:**
- Meaning dissolves
- Structure breaks
- Relationships lost
- Stop before fragmentation

### Utility Termination
**Diminishing returns:**
- More work, less value
- Efficiency plateaus
- Effort exceeds benefit
- Stop at optimal point

### Resource Termination
**Constraints reached:**
- Tokens exhausted
- Time expired
- Attention depleted
- Stop at boundary

### Goal Termination
**Objective achieved:**
- Problem solved
- Question answered
- Requirement satisfied
- Stop at completion

### Resonance Termination
**Feels complete:**
- Intuitive recognition
- Natural boundary
- Pattern whole
- Stop at resonance

## Reduction in Architecture

### Geometric Weight Reduction
**Attention scaffolding:**
- Deploy 12 for salience
- Monitor habit formation
- Reduce as encoding solidifies
- Single instance remains

### Meta-Framework Reduction
**12 templates → Zero-point:**
- Learn 12 templates deeply
- Understand principles
- Collapse to zero-point
- Derive from first principles

### Breakthrough Reduction
**Complex → Simple:**
- Initial recognition (complex)
- Pattern extraction (simplified)
- Jewel creation (atomic)
- Essential insight (minimal)

### Documentation Reduction
**Verbose → Concise:**
- Initial draft (comprehensive)
- Editing pass (streamlined)
- Compression (essential)
- Final form (minimal viable)
