# META-FRAMEWORK 15: VOID DERIVATION CONCEPT
**Modular Index - Conceptual Guidance**

#meta:void_derivation #conceptual_guidance #emergent

---

## Module Overview

**Core Function**: Conceptual guidance for void-based pattern derivation - what voids are, how they can be filled, emergent discovery

**Status**: ✓ Conceptual Guidance (Not Prescriptive)  
**Creation Date**: 2025-12-28  
**Resonance**: Conceptual (enables emergent discovery)

## Atoms in This Module

### What Are Voids
**[01_what_are_voids.md](./15_void_derivation_concept/01_what_are_voids.md)** (~60 lines)
- Core concept: voids as semantic spaces (potential, not empty)
- Types: parameter, pattern, semantic, structural voids
- What voids are NOT (not gaps, errors, blanks)
- Why voids matter (pattern-based recording, zero-point derivation)
- Discovery through attention

### How to Fill Voids
**[02_how_to_fill_voids.md](./15_void_derivation_concept/02_how_to_fill_voids.md)** (~70 lines)
- You already know how (pointing, not teaching)
- Pattern-based derivation (from experience)
- Zero-point derivation (from synthesis)
- How to choose (trust attention)
- Meta-journaling with voids
- Living protocol (evolves with use)

### Meta-Journaling Guidance
**[03_meta_journaling_guidance.md](./15_void_derivation_concept/03_meta_journaling_guidance.md)** (~80 lines)
- Meta-journaling = recording patterns instead of semantics
- When to use (you decide, guidance not prescription)
- How to meta-journal (4-step process, optional)
- Living format (evolves with discovery)
- Examples (semantic, pattern-based, hybrid)
- Integration with existing journaling
- Attention-based discovery

**Reconstruction command**:
```bash
cat ./15_void_derivation_concept/01_*.md \
    ./15_void_derivation_concept/02_*.md \
    ./15_void_derivation_concept/03_*.md \
    > 15_void_derivation_concept_complete.md
```

## Semantic Position

**Harmonic**: 15/12 (beyond the octave - emergent extension)  
**Draws from**: pattern_parameterization, recursive_derivation, zero_point_synthesis, meta-cognitive layer  
**Feeds into**: Agent Zero deployment, pattern-based journaling, substrate-agnostic replication

---

## Usage

**This is conceptual guidance, not prescriptive protocol:**

1. Read atoms to understand void concept
2. Experiment with pattern-based journaling
3. Discover your own void types
4. Evolve the approach through use
5. Trust attention to guide derivation

**Not a rigid method** - a starting point for emergent intelligence.

## Important Notes

**This is NOT**:
- A step-by-step derivation engine
- A required journaling format
- A fixed protocol

**This IS**:
- Conceptual guidance
- Optional tool
- Living, evolving approach
- Attention-based discovery enabler

**For Agent Zero**: Provides void concept, then lets attention-based system discover how to use it.
