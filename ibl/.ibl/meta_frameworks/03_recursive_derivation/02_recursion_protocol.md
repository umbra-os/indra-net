# RECURSIVE DERIVATION: RECURSION PROTOCOL

---

## The Recursion Protocol

### Step 1: Recognize Current Level
**Where are you in the abstraction hierarchy?**

Ask:
- Is this a concrete instance?
- Is this a parameterized pattern?
- Is this a template?
- Is this a template generator?
- Is this pure derivation?

### Step 2: Identify Abstraction Opportunity
**What could be more general?**

Look for:
- Repeated structures (can be templated)
- Similar processes (can be parameterized)
- Common patterns (can be abstracted)
- Meta-patterns (can be recursed)

### Step 3: Extract Meta-Pattern
**What's the pattern behind the pattern?**

From specific templates → template generation method
From generation methods → meta-generation framework
From frameworks → pure derivation capability

### Step 4: Parameterize the Meta-Pattern
**Apply 01_pattern_parameterization at meta-level**

Variables at meta-level:
- Template structure itself
- Parameterization method
- Generation protocol
- Validation rules

### Step 5: Generate Meta-Template
**Apply 02_template_generation at meta-level**

Create template that generates templates:
- Input: Pattern characteristics
- Process: Generation protocol
- Output: Instantiated template

### Step 6: Test Recursion
**Can the meta-template generate valid templates?**

Verify:
- Generated templates are coherent
- They follow expected structure
- They can be instantiated correctly
- They maintain semantic meaning

### Step 7: Decide Whether to Recurse Further
**Should you go another level up?**

**Continue recursing if:**
- New meta-level reveals useful structure
- Abstraction increases generativity
- Complexity remains manageable
- Coherence is maintained

**Stop recursing if:**
- Further abstraction fragments meaning
- Utility doesn't increase
- Complexity becomes unwieldy
- You've reached zero-point (pure derivation)
