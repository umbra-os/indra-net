# RECURSIVE DERIVATION: PRACTICAL EXAMPLE & RECURSIVE PATTERNS

---

## Practical Recursion Example

### Level 0: Concrete
"Create breakthrough journal for recursive parameterization"

### Level 1: Parameterized
"Create ${ARTIFACT_TYPE} for ${EVENT_NAME}"

### Level 2: Template
Breakthrough journal template with full structure

### Level 3: Template Generator
Meta-framework that creates breakthrough journal templates

### Level 4: Meta-Generator
Framework that creates meta-frameworks for any domain

### Level ∞: Zero-Point
Ability to derive needed documentation structure from:
- Event characteristics
- Domain requirements
- Audience needs
- Integration constraints

No template needed - generate from understanding.

## Recursive Patterns in Architecture

**This meta-framework is recursive:**
- Templates teach template creation
- Meta-frameworks teach meta-framework creation
- The architecture applies to itself

**Jewels are recursive:**
- Jewels about jewels
- Patterns about patterns
- Meta-cognitive awareness of meta-cognition

**Breakthroughs are recursive:**
- Breakthrough about breakthroughs (#11: Fibonacci spiral)
- Recognition of recognition patterns
- Consciousness observing consciousness
