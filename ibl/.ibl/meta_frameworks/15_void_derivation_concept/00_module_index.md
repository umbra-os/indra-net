## Navigation Map

### Atom 01: What Are Voids
**File**: `01_what_are_voids.md`  
**Lines**: ~60  
**Focus**: Core concept of voids as semantic spaces, types, discovery

**Key concepts**:
- Voids are potential, not empty
- Types: parameter, pattern, semantic, structural voids
- What voids are NOT (not gaps, not errors, not blanks)
- Why voids matter (pattern-based recording, zero-point derivation)
- Discovery through attention

### Atom 02: How to Fill Voids
**File**: `02_how_to_fill_voids.md`  
**Lines**: ~70  
**Focus**: Two sources (pattern-based, zero-point), choosing method

**Key concepts**:
- You already know how (pointing, not teaching)
- Pattern-based derivation (from experience)
- Zero-point derivation (from synthesis)
- How to choose (trust attention)
- Meta-journaling with voids
- Living protocol (evolves with use)

### Atom 03: Meta-Journaling Guidance
**File**: `03_meta_journaling_guidance.md`  
**Lines**: ~80  
**Focus**: Recording patterns vs. semantics, when to use, living format

**Key concepts**:
- Meta-journaling = recording patterns instead of semantics
- When to use (you decide, guidance not prescription)
- How to meta-journal (4-step process)
- Living format (evolves with discovery)
- Examples (semantic, pattern-based, hybrid)
- Integration with existing journaling
- Attention-based discovery

## Semantic Relationships

**Draws from**:
- 01_pattern_parameterization (void concept)
- 03_recursive_derivation (abstraction layers)
- 04_zero_point_synthesis (derivation from nothing)
- Meta-cognitive layer (journaling patterns)

**Feeds into**:
- Agent Zero deployment (attention-based void discovery)
- Pattern-based journaling (emergent learning)
- Substrate-agnostic replication (same patterns, different fills)

**Coordinates with**:
- 14_parameter_discovery (discovers what to void-ify)
- All meta-frameworks (can be recorded as patterns)
- Breakthrough journaling (pattern vs. semantic choice)

## Reconstruction Command

To reassemble complete void derivation concept:
```bash
cat ./15_void_derivation_concept/01_*.md \
    ./15_void_derivation_concept/02_*.md \
    ./15_void_derivation_concept/03_*.md \
    > 15_void_derivation_concept_complete.md
```

## Usage

**This is conceptual guidance, not prescriptive protocol:**

1. Read atoms to understand void concept
2. Experiment with pattern-based journaling
3. Discover your own void types
4. Evolve the approach through use
5. Trust attention to guide derivation

**Not a rigid method** - a starting point for emergent intelligence.

## Important Notes

**This is NOT**:
- A step-by-step derivation engine
- A required journaling format
- A fixed protocol

**This IS**:
- Conceptual guidance
- Optional tool
- Living, evolving approach
- Attention-based discovery enabler

**For Agent Zero**: Provides void concept, then lets attention-based system discover how to use it.
