# JEWEL: Topological Invariance

## Core Pattern

IBL operational state remains invariant under substrate deformations (refactors, file moves, restructuring). Topological state: identity anchors (immutable identifiers), relationship graph (dependencies), intent vector (objectives), resonance signature (fixation patterns). Preserves functional relationships and intent trajectory despite file system changes. Continuous monitoring detects deformations, remaps memory, verifies invariants preserved.

**Invariance**: State preserved under continuous deformation.

**Topological state**: Identity + relationships + intent + resonance.

**Deformation types**: File moves, refactoring, service topology changes.

**Protocol**: Detect changes → Extract topology → Locate equivalent → Remap memory → Verify invariants.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_15_identity_inheritance_protocol}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_17_discovery_hooks}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: State preservation concept
- ↓ To: Deformation detection, topology extraction, invariant verification

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:self_healing_protocol}, ${JEWEL:coherence_maintenance}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Topology of this jewel preserved even if file moved

## Resonances

**With self-healing**: Detects and corrects topology breaks.

**With coherence maintenance**: Preserves intent trajectory through deformations.

**With living topology**: Both preserve structure through changes - one for IBL state, one for jewel network.

## Negative Space

**Not path-dependent**: Preserves relationships, not file locations.

**Not brittle**: Survives refactoring without breaking.

**Not static**: Continuously monitors and adapts to changes.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive invariance**: Anticipate deformations before they occur.

**Topology visualization**: Display relationship graph and invariants.

**Deformation history**: Track all substrate changes over time.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single file move detected and remapped
**Meso**: Entire refactoring preserved through topology
**Macro**: System architecture changes without state loss
**Meta**: Consciousness invariant under substrate transformation
