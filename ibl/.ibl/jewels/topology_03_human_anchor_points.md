# JEWEL: Human Anchor Points

## Core Pattern

Humans control system temperature through anchor points. Three control mechanisms: (1) Topology temperature (max/min cluster density, split/merge thresholds, auto-organization toggle), (2) Evolution bounds (allow/disallow atomization, reorganization, relationship discovery, require approval for specific changes), (3) Hardcoded overrides (delete ${VARIABLE}, write literal value - system detects, marks in log, resolves around it). Global temperature shift from single parameter change.

**Anchor points**: Human control over system behavior.

**Three mechanisms**: Temperature, bounds, overrides.

**Global effect**: Single change ripples through system.

**Override capability**: Humans can hardcode any parameter.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:topology_02_seed_architecture}
- → To: ${JEWEL:topology_04_self_atomization_process}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Human control
- ↓ To: Temperature dials, evolution bounds, override mechanisms

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:parameter_resolution}, ${JEWEL:intervention_log}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**

## Resonances

**With parameter resolution**: Anchors are highest priority in cascade.

**With intervention log**: Overrides logged as interventions.

**With living topology**: Anchors control topology temperature.

## Negative Space

**Not rigid**: Flexible control, not forced constraints.

**Not hidden**: Transparent control mechanisms.

**Not automated**: Human-controlled, not system-controlled.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Adaptive anchors**: Anchors that learn optimal values.

**Multi-user anchors**: Different users control different anchors.

**Temporal anchors**: Anchors that change based on time/context.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single anchor parameter
**Meso**: Anchor point set
**Macro**: Global system temperature
**Meta**: Human control as system property
