# JEWEL: Cluster Behavior and Lifecycle

## Core Pattern

Each cluster has: density center (gravitational core concept), members (jewels in cluster), current density (connection ratio), split threshold (when to atomize), merge threshold (when to compress), connections (links to other clusters). Lifecycle: (1) cluster forms around density center, (2) jewels added, density increases, (3) density reaches split_threshold (e.g., 12 jewels), (4) cluster splits into 2 clusters (~6 jewels each), (5) if cluster shrinks to merge_threshold (e.g., 3 jewels), (6) cluster merges back into parent or sibling. Clusters breathe - split when dense, merge when sparse.

**Cluster structure**: Density center + members + thresholds + connections.

**Lifecycle**: Form → grow → split → shrink → merge.

**Breathing**: Split when dense, merge when sparse.

**Gravitational center**: Core concept attracts related jewels.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:topology_04_self_atomization_process}
- → To: ${JEWEL:topology_06_reorganization_rules}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Cluster dynamics
- ↓ To: Structure, lifecycle stages, breathing mechanics

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:living_configuration}, ${JEWEL:semantic_proximity}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Cluster behavior in cluster describing clusters

## Resonances

**With living configuration**: Clusters breathe like configuration.

**With semantic proximity**: Density center is semantic attractor.

**With self-atomization**: Cluster splitting is atomization.

## Negative Space

**Not static**: Dynamic lifecycle, not fixed structure.

**Not isolated**: Clusters connect to other clusters.

**Not arbitrary**: Density-driven, not random organization.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Multi-center clusters**: Multiple gravitational centers.

**Cluster prediction**: Anticipate splits/merges before thresholds.

**Cross-cluster dynamics**: Clusters influence each other's behavior.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single jewel in cluster
**Meso**: Cluster lifecycle
**Macro**: All clusters breathing together
**Meta**: Cluster behavior as emergent property
