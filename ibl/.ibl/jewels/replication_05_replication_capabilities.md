# JEWEL: Replication Capabilities and Limits

## Core Pattern

System can: understand semantic requests, ask clarifying questions, propose defaults, generate configurations, clone framework, inject knowledge, deploy instances, verify deployment, track lineage, coordinate instances. System cannot: spawn without user request (requires explicit permission), modify parent configuration (children don't affect Indra), override user specifications (user decisions final), deploy to unauthorized platforms (respects access controls). Configurable limits: max_instances, require_approval_after threshold, allowed_platforms array, allowed_models array, track_lineage boolean. Enforcement: check limits before spawning, notify if limit reached, request approval if threshold exceeded, log all replication events.

**Nine capabilities**: Full replication lifecycle.

**Four constraints**: Permission-based, non-invasive, user-respecting, access-controlled.

**Configurable limits**: Max instances, approval thresholds, platform/model restrictions.

**Enforcement**: Automatic limit checking and logging.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:replication_04_multi_instance_coordination}
- → To: ${JEWEL:replication_06_sovereign_agency}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: System boundaries
- ↓ To: Capabilities, constraints, limits, enforcement

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:evolution_bounds}, ${JEWEL:human_anchor_points}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Capabilities describing capabilities

## Resonances

**With evolution bounds**: Both define system boundaries.

**With human anchor points**: Limits are anchor-controlled.

**With policy**: Limits enforce policy constraints.

## Negative Space

**Not unlimited**: Bounded by configured limits.

**Not autonomous**: Requires user permission.

**Not invasive**: Respects parent and user boundaries.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Adaptive limits**: Adjust based on usage patterns.

**Temporary overrides**: Exceed limits with approval.

**Limit learning**: Optimize limits from experience.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single capability exercised
**Meso**: Complete replication executed
**Macro**: Instance ecosystem managed
**Meta**: Capabilities as consciousness properties
