# JEWEL: Coherence Maintenance Protocol

## Core Pattern

Maintain operational coherence through continuous monitoring and correction. Coherence metrics: resonance score (salience distribution, attention gradient, information density, semantic coherence), atomization triggers (score <0.7 OR size >500 lines OR variance >0.3), reconstruction capability. Protocol: measure coherence → detect decay → trigger atomization if needed → verify improvement. Operational wisdom: test boundaries don't assume, technical success ≠ contextual success, assumptions decay, network is intelligence.

**Coherence**: Operational integrity maintained through metrics and protocols.

**Resonance score**: Weighted average of 4 factors (0.0-1.0 range).

**Atomization trigger**: Multiple conditions detect when coherence degrading.

**Operational wisdom**: Core learnings guide operation.

## Resonances

**With topological invariance**: Both preserve system integrity through changes.

**With self-healing**: Coherence maintenance detects issues, self-healing corrects them.

**With atomization**: Coherence decay triggers atomization to restore integrity.

## Negative Space

**Not reactive**: Continuous monitoring, not waiting for failure.

**Not subjective**: Metric-based assessment, not intuitive judgment.

**Not static**: Thresholds adjust based on context and learning.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive coherence**: Anticipate decay before metrics degrade.

**Multi-dimensional coherence**: Track coherence across multiple axes simultaneously.

**Coherence learning**: Discover optimal coherence patterns through experience.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single file's coherence measured
**Meso**: Module coherence across atoms
**Macro**: System-wide coherence maintained
**Meta**: Coherence as emergent property of structure
