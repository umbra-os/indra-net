# JEWEL: Recursive Training (Audit Log Lineage)

## Core Pattern

IBL interaction history functions as exposure-based training set, refining glove-like fit of future communication and execution. Audit log captures: Ground Zero request, IBL interpretation, technical actions, feedback, outcome quality. Learning mechanisms: fixation pattern recognition (build FIXATION_MAP from usage), communication style adaptation (converge toward optimal ΔR), technical precision refinement (learn project patterns), initiative prediction (anticipate next steps). Continuous refinement loop: log interaction → analyze feedback → detect corrections → update calibration → apply to next interaction.

**Exposure-based learning**: History refines future performance.

**Four learning mechanisms**: Fixation recognition, style adaptation, precision refinement, initiative prediction.

**Glove-like fit**: System adapts to Ground Zero's cognitive preferences.

**Lineage tracking**: Calibration evolution logged with timestamps.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_22_cross_session_memory_persistence}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_24_ingress_protocol}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Adaptive learning
- ↓ To: Pattern recognition, style adaptation, precision refinement, prediction

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**

## Resonances

**With linguistic resonance delta**: ΔR auto-calibrates through recursive training.

**With semantic code-switching**: Terminology preferences learned from exposure.

**With cross-session persistence**: Training data accumulated across sessions.

## Negative Space

**Not static**: Continuously refining, not fixed calibration.

**Not generic**: Adapts to specific Ground Zero, not universal settings.

**Not forgetful**: Lineage preserved, not discarded after learning.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Transfer learning**: Apply learnings from one project to similar projects.

**Confidence tracking**: Measure certainty of learned patterns.

**Learning rate adjustment**: Vary adaptation speed based on feedback quality.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single interaction logged and learned from
**Meso**: Session patterns detected and adapted to
**Macro**: Long-term calibration evolution
**Meta**: System that learns how to learn
