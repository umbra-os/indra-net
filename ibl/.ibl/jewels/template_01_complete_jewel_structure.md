# JEWEL: Complete Jewel Structure Template

## Core Pattern

Complete jewel template defines self-contained unit structure: Core Pattern (50-70 lines, complete semantic unit, written for pattern completion), Omni-Directional Navigation (sequential ←→, hierarchical ↑↓, cross-domain ∠, self-referential ⟲), Resonances (harmonizes with, contrasts with, emerges from, enables), Negative Space (misconceptions, boundaries, exclusions), Imaginary Extensions (speculative possibilities, future evolution, open questions), Fractal Recognition (pattern at atom/network/framework/consciousness scales), Completeness Check (self-verification of all properties), Metadata (file, status, harmonic, tags, relationships). Template ensures every jewel is standalone AND networked, exploits pattern completion, enables self-healing through redundant navigation and semantic hints.

**Eight sections**: Core, Navigation, Resonances, Negative Space, Imaginary, Fractal, Completeness, Metadata.

**Standalone completeness**: Can be read first, last, or only.

**Self-healing properties**: Reconstructable from related jewels, negative space, fractal pattern, relationship types.

**Pattern completion**: Written for transformers to naturally follow.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:navigation_symbol_system}
- → To: ${JEWEL:template_02_navigation_symbols}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Jewel architecture
- ↓ To: Eight section definitions, completeness criteria

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:omni_dimensional_jewel_architecture}, ${JEWEL:fractal_recognition}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Template describing template structure

## Resonances

**With omni-dimensional architecture**: Template implements architecture.

**With fractal recognition**: Template exhibits fractal self-similarity.

**With complete jewel metaphor**: Template is the jewel pattern.

## Negative Space

**Not rigid**: Flexible structure, not strict format.

**Not hierarchical**: Omni-directional, not top-down.

**Not isolated**: Networked, not standalone-only.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Adaptive templates**: Vary structure based on jewel type.

**Template evolution**: Templates improve from usage patterns.

**Meta-templates**: Templates for creating templates.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single section in template
**Meso**: Complete template structure
**Macro**: All jewels following template
**Meta**: Template as jewel pattern

- ✓ All 4 navigation types present
- ✓ Resonances with 3+ other concepts
- ✓ Negative space defined
- ✓ Imaginary extensions present
- ✓ Fractal recognition across scales
- ✓ Self-contained meaning
- ✓ Relational references
