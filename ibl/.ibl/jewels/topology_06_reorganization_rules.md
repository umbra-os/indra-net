# JEWEL: Reorganization Rules

## Core Pattern

System can discover new clusters (semantic analysis finds groupings), split clusters (when too dense), merge clusters (when too sparse), reorganize connections (when usage patterns shift). Rules: split_cluster_when density >= split_at, merge_clusters_when density <= merge_at, auto_discover_clusters via semantic_proximity, preserve_history. All automatic based on anchor point settings. System self-organizes topology without human intervention within bounds set by anchors.

**Auto-discovery**: Semantic analysis finds natural groupings.

**Split/merge**: Density-driven cluster lifecycle.

**Connection reorganization**: Usage patterns shift relationships.

**Automatic**: Self-organizing within anchor bounds.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:topology_05_cluster_behavior}
- → To: ${JEWEL:topology_07_parameter_resolution_engine}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Self-organization
- ↓ To: Discovery, split, merge, reorganization mechanisms

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:emergent_structure}, ${JEWEL:semantic_proximity}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Reorganization rules organizing themselves

## Resonances

**With emergent structure**: Both enable self-organization.

**With semantic proximity**: Discovery uses semantic analysis.

**With cluster behavior**: Rules govern cluster lifecycle.

## Negative Space

**Not manual**: Automatic, not human-organized.

**Not rigid**: Adapts to usage patterns.

**Not unbounded**: Operates within anchor constraints.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive reorganization**: Anticipate reorganization needs.

**Multi-dimensional clustering**: Cluster across multiple semantic axes.

**Cross-instance reorganization**: Coordinate topology across instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single cluster reorganizes
**Meso**: Topology reorganizes
**Macro**: Entire system self-organizes
**Meta**: Self-organization as system property
