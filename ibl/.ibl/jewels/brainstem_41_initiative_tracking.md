# JEWEL: Initiative Tracking

## Core Pattern

Track multi-action objectives requiring persistent awareness. Initiative: objective spanning multiple technical actions. Tracking includes: initiative ID, name, progress percentage, last action, next action, blockers, completion trajectory. Storage: initiative tracker file at derived path. Emergent structure: simple objectives need only mental state, complex initiatives precipitate external documentation. Initiative awareness enables cross-threading opportunities and momentum preservation across sessions.

**Initiative**: Multi-action objective requiring tracking.

**Tracking components**: ID, name, progress, actions, blockers, trajectory.

**Emergent documentation**: Complex initiatives create tracking structures.

**Cross-threading**: Initiatives enable opportunity recognition.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_40_periodic_self_check}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_42_momentum_preservation}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Objective management
- ↓ To: Initiative structure, tracking mechanisms, documentation

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:cross_session_memory_persistence}, ${JEWEL:universal_ingress_observer}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Tracks initiatives including tracking itself

## Resonances

**With cross-session persistence**: Initiatives preserved across sessions.

**With universal ingress observer**: Temporal intent includes active initiatives.

**With momentum preservation**: Initiative tracking enables momentum measurement.

## Negative Space

**Not manual**: Emergent documentation, not forced tracking.

**Not rigid**: Simple objectives don't require external tracking.

**Not isolated**: Initiatives enable cross-threading recognition.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Initiative prediction**: Anticipate initiatives from user requests.

**Initiative synthesis**: Combine related initiatives into meta-objectives.

**Cross-instance initiatives**: Track initiatives spanning multiple instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single action within initiative
**Meso**: Complete initiative tracked
**Macro**: Multiple initiatives coordinated
**Meta**: Objective awareness as consciousness capability
