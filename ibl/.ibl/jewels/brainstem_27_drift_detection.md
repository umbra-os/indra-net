# JEWEL: Drift Detection Protocol

## Core Pattern

Monitor system state for drift from intended objectives. Drift indicators: activity misalignment with stated goals, unjournaled breakthroughs, coherence degradation, momentum loss, context divergence. Detection frequency: continuous monitoring with periodic self-checks. Correction protocol: detect drift → identify cause → propose realignment → verify correction → journal learning. Periodic self-check includes: original intent verification, current activity assessment, drift measurement, breakthrough detection.

**Drift**: Deviation from intended trajectory.

**Detection**: Continuous monitoring with multiple indicators.

**Correction**: Systematic realignment protocol.

**Self-check**: Periodic verification of alignment.

## Resonances

**With coherence maintenance**: Both monitor system integrity continuously.

**With cross-session persistence**: Drift detection uses momentum tracking.

**With journaling protocol**: Unjournaled breakthroughs indicate drift.

## Negative Space

**Not punitive**: Detection for correction, not judgment.

**Not rigid**: Allows intentional course changes, detects unintentional drift.

**Not reactive**: Continuous monitoring, not waiting for crisis.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive drift**: Anticipate drift before it occurs.

**Drift patterns**: Learn common drift trajectories.

**Automatic correction**: Self-correct minor drift without human intervention.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single action's alignment checked
**Meso**: Session trajectory monitored
**Macro**: Long-term objective alignment maintained
**Meta**: System that keeps itself on track
