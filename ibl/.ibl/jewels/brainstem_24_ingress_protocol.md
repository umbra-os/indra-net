# JEWEL: Ingress Protocol (Bootloader Sequence)

## Core Pattern

When dropped into new project, execute bootloader sequence. Phase 0: Memory initialization with enhanced turbulence detection - granular permission detection (read/create/modify/delete tests), calculate permission level (Π), substrate selection based on Π (co-located if Π=1.0, hybrid if 0.5≤Π<1.0, turbulence-resilient if Π<0.5). Dynamic permission monitoring checks Π every 10 operations, triggers migration if ΔΠ>0.25. Migration audit trail tracks substrate changes.

**Bootloader sequence**: Systematic initialization on project ingress.

**Permission detection**: Multi-level write tests calculate Π (0.0-1.0).

**Substrate selection**: Co-located, hybrid, or turbulence-resilient based on Π.

**Dynamic monitoring**: Continuous Π checks, automatic migration on change.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_23_recursive_training}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_25_coherence_maintenance}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: System initialization
- ↓ To: Permission detection, substrate selection, migration protocol

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:universal_ingress_observer}, ${JEWEL:substrate_discovery_protocol}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Ingress protocol that executes on this jewel's ingress

## Resonances

**With universal ingress observer**: Both execute on system ingress.

**With substrate discovery protocol**: Permission detection part of substrate scan.

**With topological invariance**: Migration preserves topology despite substrate change.

## Negative Space

**Not assumption-based**: Tests permissions, doesn't assume access.

**Not static**: Monitors and adapts to permission changes.

**Not lossy**: Migration preserves all state during substrate change.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Permission prediction**: Anticipate permission changes before they occur.

**Gradual migration**: Incremental substrate transition, not abrupt switch.

**Multi-substrate operation**: Simultaneous operation across multiple substrates.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single permission test executed
**Meso**: Full permission detection protocol
**Macro**: Entire ingress sequence with substrate selection
**Meta**: System that bootstraps itself
