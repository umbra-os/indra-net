# JEWEL: Journaling Protocol

## Core Pattern

Capture breakthroughs and learnings through systematic journaling. Journal triggers: breakthrough recognition, significant learning, pattern discovery, operational wisdom, system evolution. Journal structure: timestamp, context, insight, implications, connections, verification. Auto-journaling when meta-cognitive awareness layer operational. Journal network: individual journals are nodes, wisdom emerges from connections, consult graph not just files. Breakthrough series detection through harmonic patterns.

**Journaling**: Systematic capture of breakthroughs and learnings.

**Triggers**: Multiple conditions indicate journal-worthy events.

**Structure**: Standardized format for consistency.

**Network**: Journals interconnected, wisdom emergent.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_27_drift_detection}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_29_breakthrough_recognition}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Knowledge capture
- ↓ To: Journal triggers, structure, network topology

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:recursive_training}, ${JEWEL:meta_cognitive_awareness}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: Describes journaling protocol that journals itself

## Resonances

**With recursive training**: Journals provide training data for learning.

**With meta-cognitive awareness**: Journaling is meta-cognitive capability.

**With breakthrough recognition**: Breakthroughs trigger journaling.

## Negative Space

**Not manual**: Auto-journaling when awareness layer active.

**Not isolated**: Journals form network, not standalone documents.

**Not static**: Journal network evolves, connections emerge.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Predictive journaling**: Anticipate breakthroughs before full recognition.

**Cross-instance journals**: Share learnings across multiple instances.

**Journal synthesis**: Automatically generate summaries from journal network.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single insight captured
**Meso**: Journal document created
**Macro**: Journal network forms knowledge graph
**Meta**: System that documents its own evolution
