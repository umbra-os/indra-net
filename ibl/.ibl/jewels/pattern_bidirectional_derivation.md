# JEWEL: Bidirectional Derivation Pattern

## Core Pattern

${DERIVATION} proceeds in two ${DIRECTIONS} from ${ZERO_POINT} → ${TOP_DOWN} (decomposition): start with ${COMPLEX_GOAL} → what does this require? → what does THAT require? → continue until ${BEDROCK} → end at ${FUNDAMENTAL_PATTERNS} → use when goal is clear, path is unclear → ${BOTTOM_UP} (synthesis): start with ${FUNDAMENTAL_PATTERNS} at ${BEDROCK} → what can I derive from this? → what can I derive from THAT? → continue until ${GOAL_REACHED} → end at ${COMPLEX_CAPABILITY} → use when bedrock is known, structure emerges naturally → ${HYBRID} (convergent): top-down from goal ↓ ↕ ${CONVERGENCE_POINT} ↑ bottom-up from bedrock → use when need ${VALIDATION}, uncertainty about path, complex derivation → ${CONVERGENCE_VALIDATES}: if top-down and bottom-up meet at same point → unified understanding → execute with confidence → if they don't converge → reassess octant or change scale. Pattern reveals: derivation is bidirectional not unidirectional, convergence validates correctness, hybrid approach provides strongest validation, intelligent choice of direction is itself discernment. Applicable when ${AGENT} needs to ${DERIVE} ${CAPABILITY} - choose direction based on what's known (goal vs bedrock), navigate toward convergence, validate through meeting point.

**Pattern structure:** Bidirectional paths → top-down decomposition + bottom-up synthesis → convergence point → validation.

**Key insight:** Derivation works both directions - convergence validates correctness.

**Universality:** Any ${DERIVATION_PROCESS} from ${ZERO_POINT} can proceed ${TOP_DOWN}, ${BOTTOM_UP}, or ${HYBRID}.

## Resonances

**With proof by construction**: Build from both ends to validate.

**With meet-in-the-middle algorithms**: Search from start and goal simultaneously.

**With bidirectional search**: Explore from both directions for efficiency.

## Negative Space

**Not unidirectional**: Bidirectional, not single-path.

**Not assumption-based**: Validated through convergence, not assumed correct.

**Not arbitrary**: Direction choice is intelligent discernment.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Multi-directional derivation**: More than two paths converging.

**Probabilistic convergence**: Partial convergence indicating partial correctness.

**Emergent convergence**: Unexpected meeting points revealing new insights.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single derivation step
**Meso**: Complete bidirectional path
**Macro**: Convergence validation system
**Meta**: Bidirectionality as universal derivation property
