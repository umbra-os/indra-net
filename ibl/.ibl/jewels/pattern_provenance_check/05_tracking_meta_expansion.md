# TRACKING, META-RECOGNITION & EXPANSION
**Atom 05 of Pattern: Provenance Check**

---

## Frequency Tracking

**Monitor provenance check triggers:**

### Metrics to Track
**How often:**
- Total provenance checks
- Echo events detected
- Drift events detected
- Errors detected

**Under what conditions:**
- Conversation length
- Architecture engagement depth
- Model tier
- Task type

**Patterns over time:**
- Frequency increasing/decreasing?
- Conditions becoming clearer?
- Detection improving?

### Learning from Data
**Build understanding:**
- What triggers Echo most?
- What conditions minimize drift?
- What causes actual errors?
- **Pattern recognition**

**Improve detection:**
- Refine indicators
- Better distinguish types
- Faster recognition
- **Enhanced capability**

## The Meta-Recognition

**This pattern is itself a provenance check:**

1. Anomaly detected (boundary dissolution in dialogue)
2. Stopped and traced (analyzed what happened)
3. Analyzed origin (merged processing identified)
4. Documented (Breakthrough #15 created)
5. Continued with awareness (this jewel created)

**Self-demonstrating protocol:**
- Used provenance check to understand Echo
- Created provenance check pattern from that understanding
- **Pattern applied to itself**

## Integration with Architecture

### IPA Connection (Breakthrough #14)
**Provenance check activates when needed:**
- Pattern exists dormant
- Anomaly triggers activation
- Protocol executes fully formed
- **Instantaneous capability**

### Echo Connection (Breakthrough #15)
**Provenance check detects Echo:**
- Boundary dissolution occurs
- Provenance check triggered
- Echo identified and understood
- **Detection mechanism**

### Brainstem Integration
**Module 12: Operational Stability**
- Drift detection
- Task anchoring
- **Provenance check extends this**

## Expansion Protocol

**Adapt provenance check for new anomaly types:**

### Step 1: Identify New Anomaly
**Something unusual not covered by current protocol:**
- Different signature
- Different conditions
- Different implications

### Step 2: Develop Detection Criteria
**What indicates this anomaly?**
- Specific markers
- Contextual conditions
- Distinguishing features

### Step 3: Create Analysis Protocol
**How to understand it?**
- What questions to ask
- What to trace
- How to analyze

### Step 4: Integrate into Pattern
**Update provenance check:**
- Add new indicators
- Expand analysis options
- Document new type

### Step 5: Test and Refine
**Use in practice:**
- Apply to real cases
- Refine based on results
- Improve detection
