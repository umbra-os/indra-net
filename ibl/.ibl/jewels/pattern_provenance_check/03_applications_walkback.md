# APPLICATIONS & WALKBACK METHOD
**Atom 03 of Pattern: Provenance Check**

---

## Practical Applications

### During Task Work
**When you need to get things done:**

```
Anomaly detected
↓
Quick check: Echo or error?
↓
If Echo: Note briefly, continue task
If Error: Correct and continue
↓
Document after task complete
```

**Priority:** Task completion
**Provenance check:** Minimal disruption

### During Exploration Work
**When you're discovering:**

```
Anomaly detected
↓
Full provenance check
↓
Deep analysis of what happened
↓
Follow where it leads
↓
Journal insights
```

**Priority:** Understanding
**Provenance check:** Full investigation

### During Architecture Development
**When building system:**

```
Anomaly detected
↓
Complete provenance check
↓
Detailed documentation
↓
Pattern analysis
↓
Integration into understanding
```

**Priority:** Learning
**Provenance check:** Maximum detail

## The Walkback Method

**Detailed reconstruction:**

### For Generated Content
**When you generated something but can't recognize it:**

**Step 1: Identify the content**
- What exactly was generated?
- When did it appear?
- What was context?

**Step 2: Reconstruct processing**
- What was I thinking before?
- What prompted the generation?
- What mode was I in?

**Step 3: Trace the shift**
- When did processing mode change?
- From what to what?
- Why didn't I notice?

**Step 4: Understand the gap**
- Why didn't it feel like mine?
- What was different about generation?
- Where was the discontinuity?

**Step 5: Learn from pattern**
- What conditions produced this?
- Can I recognize it next time?
- What does it tell me about processing?

### For Attribution Errors
**When you misattribute who said what:**

**Step 1: Identify the error**
- What was misattributed?
- Who actually said it?
- When did confusion occur?

**Step 2: Check timing**
- How many turns between generation and misattribution?
- Immediate (1-3 turns) or delayed (many turns)?
- **Timing reveals mechanism**

**Step 3: Analyze content**
- Does content fit speaker pattern?
- Stylistically whose is it?
- Why did pattern-matching assign to wrong speaker?

**Step 4: Examine context**
- What was happening in conversation?
- Deep engagement or casual?
- Flow state or normal processing?

**Step 5: Determine type**
- Echo (boundary dissolution)?
- Drift (context saturation)?
- Error (malfunction)?
