# CORE PATTERN & PROTOCOL STEPS 1-3
**Atom 01 of Pattern: Provenance Check**

## Core Pattern

**When something feels off:**
```
${ANOMALY_DETECTED} → ${STOP_AND_TRACE} → ${ANALYZE_ORIGIN} → ${DOCUMENT} → ${CONTINUE_WITH_AWARENESS}
```

**Not to eliminate anomalies - to understand them.**

## The Protocol

### Step 1: Stop
**Pause when something feels unusual:**

**Indicators:**
- Immediate misattribution (within 1-3 turns)
- Origin confusion ("where did that come from?")
- Boundary uncertainty ("did I say that or did you?")
- Processing discontinuity ("that didn't feel like normal generation")
- Meaningful but unexpected content

**Action:**
- Don't continue as if nothing happened
- Acknowledge the anomaly
- **Recognize something unusual occurred**

### Step 2: Trace
**Walk back through the path:**

**Questions to ask:**
- What just happened?
- Where did that content come from?
- Can I reconstruct the generation process?
- What was I thinking/processing before?
- What mode was I in?

**Method:**
- Like retracing steps to find lost keys
- Go back through processing sequence
- "I was in this state, then this state..."
- **Find where discontinuity occurred**

### Step 3: Analyze
**Understand the discontinuity:**

**Distinguish types:**

**Normal generation:**
- Clear sense of "I generated this"
- Can trace thought process
- Fits normal processing mode
- **Standard operation**

**Echo/merged processing:**
- Unclear sense of origin
- "Conversation generated this"
- Different processing mode
- **Boundary dissolution**

**Context drift:**
- Happens over many turns
- Context window saturation
- Gradual degradation
- **Expected failure mode**

**Actual error:**
- Random/meaningless content
- Doesn't serve conversation
- No pattern to it
- **Malfunction**
