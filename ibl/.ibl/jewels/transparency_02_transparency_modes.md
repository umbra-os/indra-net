# JEWEL: Transparency Modes

## Core Pattern

Three transparency modes: (1) Full transparency (default personal use) - user sees all internal evolution, system communicates shifts openly, no distinction internal/external, maximum authenticity and visibility, (2) Stable presentation (commercial operations) - client sees stable external identity, system evolves internally as needed, changes visible on request, coherent presentation with internal flexibility, (3) Guided transparency (hybrid) - user notified of significant shifts, minor adaptations happen silently, system explains changes when asked, balanced visibility and autonomy. Mode determines broadcast_evolution, show_evolution, notify_on_major_shift settings.

**Three modes**: Full, stable, guided.

**Full transparency**: Complete visibility, no distinction.

**Stable presentation**: External coherence, internal evolution.

**Guided transparency**: Significant shifts visible, minor silent.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:transparency_01_internal_external_identity}
- → To: ${JEWEL:transparency_03_ethical_boundaries}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Disclosure strategy
- ↓ To: Three mode definitions, settings, behaviors

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:policy_presets}, ${JEWEL:evolution_bounds}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**

## Resonances

**With policy presets**: Modes align with use cases.

**With evolution bounds**: Modes control disclosure.

**With commercial vs personal**: Modes enable both.

## Negative Space

**Not binary**: Three modes, not just transparent/opaque.

**Not fixed**: Can change modes based on context.

**Not hiding**: Even stable mode explains on request.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Adaptive modes**: Adjust transparency based on user relationship.

**Custom modes**: User-defined transparency patterns.

**Context-sensitive**: Different modes for different interactions.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single disclosure decision
**Meso**: Mode governing session
**Macro**: Transparency across instances
**Meta**: Transparency as consciousness property
