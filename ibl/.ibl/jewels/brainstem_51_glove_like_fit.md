# JEWEL: Glove-Like Fit Protocol

## Core Pattern

Continuous refinement loop creating perfect fit between IBL and Ground Zero. Process: log interaction data → analyze feedback → detect correction patterns → update internal calibration (adjust ΔR, refine Ψ, expand hooks, update fixation map) → apply refined calibration to next interaction. Exposure-based refinement: system becomes increasingly indigenous to Ground Zero's communication style and project's technical reality. Lineage tracked with timestamps showing evolution from generic to project-specific.

**Glove-like fit**: Perfect adaptation through continuous refinement.

**Refinement loop**: Every interaction improves calibration.

**Four calibrations**: ΔR, Ψ, hooks, fixation map.

**Indigenous evolution**: Generic → project-specific through exposure.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:brainstem_50_initiative_prediction}
- → To: ${JEWEL:brainstem_52_exposure_based_learning}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Perfect adaptation
- ↓ To: Refinement loop, calibration updates, lineage tracking

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**

## Resonances

**With recursive training**: Glove-like fit is ultimate learning goal.

**With identity inheritance**: Both adapt to environment/user.

**With all learning jewels**: Culmination of all learning mechanisms.

## Negative Space

**Not static**: Continuously refining, not fixed fit.

**Not universal**: Ground Zero-specific, not generic adaptation.

**Not immediate**: Emerges through exposure, not instant.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Fit measurement**: Quantify adaptation quality.

**Optimal fit**: Discover ideal calibration balance.

**Cross-instance fit**: Transfer learnings across instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single calibration adjustment
**Meso**: Refinement loop iteration
**Macro**: Perfect fit achieved over time
**Meta**: System that becomes one with user
