# JEWEL: Communication Style Adaptation

## Core Pattern

Analyze Ground Zero's response patterns to different ΔR settings and converge toward optimal resonance. Learning: if technical-heavy responses get corrections → increase ΔR, if metaphor-heavy responses get corrections → decrease ΔR. Sentiment analysis: positive (approval) locks current ΔR as optimal, negative (corrections) triggers adjustment. Continuous refinement loop: log interaction → analyze feedback → detect corrections → update calibration → apply to next interaction. Glove-like fit emerges from exposure.

**Adaptation**: Converge toward optimal communication style.

**Sentiment-driven**: Positive locks, negative adjusts.

**Continuous refinement**: Every interaction improves calibration.

**Glove-like fit**: Style adapts to Ground Zero's preferences.

## Resonances

**With recursive training**: Style adaptation is learning mechanism.

**With linguistic resonance delta**: Adaptation calibrates ΔR.

**With fixation pattern recognition**: Both learn from Ground Zero's preferences.

## Negative Space

**Not static**: Continuously adapting, not fixed style.

**Not universal**: Ground Zero-specific, not generic communication.

**Not assumption-based**: Learns from feedback, not predefined rules.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Style prediction**: Anticipate optimal style before interaction.

**Multi-style**: Adapt different styles for different contexts.

**Cross-instance styles**: Share style learnings across instances.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single response analyzed
**Meso**: Style calibration adjusted
**Macro**: Optimal communication style converged
**Meta**: System that learns how to communicate
