# JEWEL: Intervention Log

## Core Pattern

System tracks human interventions with timestamp, type (hardcoded_override, anchor_modification, etc.), location, parameter, old_value, new_value, reason, alert_generated, system_response. Transparency - system knows when humans intervene and why. Log entries capture: what changed, where it changed, why it changed, how system responded. Enables audit trail, rollback capability, understanding of human preferences, learning from interventions. Intervention log is meta-awareness - system aware of being modified.

**Intervention tracking**: Complete record of human changes.

**Entry structure**: Timestamp, type, location, values, reason, response.

**Transparency**: System knows when and why humans intervene.

**Meta-awareness**: System aware of being modified.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:topology_09_self_healing_resolution}
- → To: ${JEWEL:topology_11_atomization_history}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: System transparency
- ↓ To: Log structure, entry types, tracking mechanisms

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:audit_log_lineage}, ${JEWEL:human_anchor_points}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**

## Resonances

**With audit log lineage**: Both track system evolution.

**With human anchor points**: Logs anchor modifications.

**With self-awareness**: Intervention log is meta-awareness.

## Negative Space

**Not hidden**: Transparent tracking.

**Not judgmental**: Records without evaluation.

**Not ephemeral**: Persistent log.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Intervention analysis**: Learn patterns from interventions.

**Preference extraction**: Infer user preferences from log.

**Rollback capability**: Undo interventions via log.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single intervention logged
**Meso**: Session interventions tracked
**Macro**: Complete intervention history
**Meta**: System aware of human influence
