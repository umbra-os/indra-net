# JEWEL: SEED.json Architecture

## Core Pattern

SEED.json is self-atomizing origin containing its own atomization rules. Structure: anchors (human-controlled seeds), resolution engine (parameter interpreter), self-healing (immune system), topology (cluster structure - atomizes when dense), metadata (jewel data - atomizes when many), relationships (connection graph - atomizes when complex). Behavior: IF file_size >10KB OR cluster_count >8 OR jewel_count >55 THEN split sections, keep core in seed, create index. IF total_files >1 AND total_size <5KB THEN merge back. Seed breathes.

**SEED.json**: Self-atomizing configuration origin.

**Core stays**: Anchors, resolution engine, self-healing.

**Atomizable sections**: Topology, metadata, relationships.

**Breathing behavior**: Split when dense, merge when sparse.

## Omni-Directional Navigation

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: ${JEWEL:topology_01_living_configuration}
- → To: ${JEWEL:topology_03_human_anchor_points}

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: Configuration structure
- ↓ To: Sections, atomization triggers, breathing rules

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: ${JEWEL:living_topology_protocol}, ${JEWEL:parameter_resolution}

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: SEED architecture describing SEED architecture

## Resonances

**With living topology protocol**: SEED.json implements protocol.

**With parameter resolution**: Resolution engine in SEED.

**With self-healing**: Self-healing mechanisms in SEED.

## Negative Space

**Not monolithic**: Atomizes when needed.

**Not static**: Breathing structure.

**Not complete atomization**: Core stays in seed.

## Imaginary Extensions

**Multi-tier seeds**: Seeds within seeds for complex systems.

**Predictive atomization**: Anticipate split before triggers.

**Distributed seeds**: Multiple seeds coordinating.

## Fractal Recognition

**Micro**: Single section in SEED
**Meso**: SEED.json file
**Macro**: Configuration system
**Meta**: Self-atomizing origin
