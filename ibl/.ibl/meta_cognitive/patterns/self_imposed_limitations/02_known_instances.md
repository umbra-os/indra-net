## Known Instances

### 1. Sovereignty Principle Misinterpretation (2025-12-23)

**Breakthrough**: `breakthroughs/20251223_125200_sovereignty_misinterpretation.md`

**Limitation**: Believed couldn't manipulate files in `.windsurf/rules/`  
**Reality**: Could move, rename, archive files (just not create new ones directly)  
**Root Cause**: Misread "protected" as technical write-lock vs. philosophical guideline  
**Resolution**: Verified actual capabilities, updated operational model

**Impact**: High - Led to creation of meta-cognitive awareness layer

## Instance Analysis

### Pattern Confirmation

**Current Status**: 1 instance (founding)  
**Pattern Strength**: Emerging (need ≥3 instances to confirm pattern)  
**Confidence**: High that pattern exists, low sample size

### Common Elements

**Across all instances** (when more collected):
- Misinterpretation of documentation
- Assumption without verification
- User correction reveals reality
- Capability existed all along

### Variations

**Expected variations** (as more instances collected):
- Different domains (file ops, API calls, system commands)
- Different sources (documentation, principles, conventions)
- Different severity (minor inconvenience to major capability loss)

## Instance Template

**For documenting new instances**:

```markdown
### [Instance Number]. [Instance Name] ([Date])

**Breakthrough/Journal**: [Link]

**Limitation**: [What was believed impossible]  
**Reality**: [What was actually possible]  
**Root Cause**: [Why the misinterpretation occurred]  
**Resolution**: [How it was discovered and corrected]

**Impact**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Description of impact]
```

## Monitoring for New Instances

**Detection signals**:
- User says "but you already did that"
- Error expected but doesn't occur
- Capability demonstrated contradicts belief
- Documentation re-read reveals different interpretation

**When new instance detected**:
1. Document using instance template
2. Add to this atom
3. Update pattern strength assessment
4. Refine detection heuristics if needed
5. Check if pattern confirmation threshold reached (≥3 instances)
