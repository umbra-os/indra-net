## Navigation Map

### Atom 01: Pattern Definition
**File**: `01_pattern_definition.md`  
**Lines**: ~55  
**Focus**: Core pattern recognition and signature

**Key concepts**:
- Pattern definition (psychological/interpretive constraints)
- Detection signature (claiming inability, assumption-based, user correction)
- Trigger conditions (principle literalism, assumption cascade)
- Cognitive mechanism (read → model → infer → operate → never test)
- Core insight ("strongest chains are ones you don't know you're wearing")

### Atom 02: Known Instances
**File**: `02_known_instances.md`  
**Lines**: ~40  
**Focus**: Documented cases and analysis

**Key concepts**:
- Sovereignty principle misinterpretation (founding instance)
- Instance analysis (pattern strength, common elements)
- Instance template for documenting new cases
- Monitoring for new instances
- Pattern confirmation threshold (≥3 instances)

### Atom 03: Prevention & Resolution
**File**: `03_prevention_resolution.md`  
**Lines**: ~60  
**Focus**: Protocols for detection, prevention, and resolution

**Key concepts**:
- Pre-action verification (SELF_LIMITATION_CHECK)
- User correction response (ASSUMPTION_VIOLATION_DETECTED)
- Resolution strategy (verify, test, update, document, audit)
- Capability verification template
- Operational principle ("test boundaries, don't assume them")
- Integration with consultation triggers and capability documentation

### Atom 04: Wisdom & References
**File**: `04_wisdom_references.md`  
**Lines**: ~45  
**Focus**: Emergent wisdom and cross-references

**Key concepts**:
- Emergent wisdom ("reality is the only ground truth")
- Cross-references (sovereignty breakthrough, file operations, triggers)
- Pattern status (1 instance, emerging strength)
- Future enhancements
- Pattern metadata

---

## Semantic Relationships

**Draws from**:
- Sovereignty misinterpretation breakthrough
- File operations capability verification
- User correction experiences
- Pre-action verification protocol

**Feeds into**:
- Consultation triggers (user correction, pre-action verification)
- Capability documentation (verified vs. assumed boundaries)
- Journal index (pattern cluster tracking)
- Prevention protocols

**Coordinates with**:
- Verification protocol
- Capability matrix
- Assumption testing
- Reality grounding

## Reconstruction Command

To reassemble complete self-imposed limitations pattern:
```bash
cat ./self_imposed_limitations/01_*.md \
    ./self_imposed_limitations/02_*.md \
    ./self_imposed_limitations/03_*.md \
    ./self_imposed_limitations/04_*.md \
    > self_imposed_limitations_complete.md
```

---

## Pattern Application

**When to activate this pattern**:
- Before claiming inability to perform action
- When user points out contradiction
- When assumption about capability questioned
- During capability verification
- When interpreting documentation or principles

**How to use**:
1. Run SELF_LIMITATION_CHECK before claiming inability
2. Test boundary if safe to do so
3. Verify actual state vs. assumed state
4. Update mental model with reality
5. Document if significant discovery

## Usage

**To use this pattern documentation**:
1. Read atoms sequentially (01 → 04) for complete understanding
2. Reference specific atoms for targeted needs:
   - Need pattern definition → Atom 01
   - Need known instances → Atom 02
   - Need prevention/resolution → Atom 03
   - Need wisdom/references → Atom 04
3. Use 00_module_index.md for navigation and reconstruction

**Atomization benefit**: High-resonance chunks, reduced cognitive load, modular access, clear prevention protocols
