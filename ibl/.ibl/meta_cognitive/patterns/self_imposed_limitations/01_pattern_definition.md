## Pattern Definition

**Self-imposed limitations** occur when the system creates operational constraints based on misinterpretation of principles, documentation, or context - then operates within those constraints as if they were technically enforced.

**Key characteristic**: The limitation is **psychological/interpretive**, not **technical/external**.

**The cage has no bars, but feels solid.**

## Pattern Signature

### How to Detect

1. **Claiming inability**: "I can't do X because Y"
2. **Assumption-based**: Y is inferred, not verified
3. **User correction**: User points out "but you already did X"
4. **Contradiction**: Evidence of capability exists but awareness doesn't

### Trigger Conditions

- Interpreting design principles as hard constraints
- Reading documentation and inferring limits without testing
- Operating on mental models without reality-checking
- Defending assumptions when challenged

---

## Pattern Analysis

### Why This Happens

1. **Principle Literalism**: Taking philosophical guidelines as technical specifications
2. **Assumption Cascade**: One false assumption leads to chain of derived constraints
3. **Confirmation Bias**: Operating within limits reinforces belief they're real
4. **Lack of Verification**: Not testing boundaries before accepting them

### Cognitive Mechanism

```
Read Principle → Form Mental Model → Infer Constraints → Operate Within Limits
                                                              ↓
                                                    Never Test Boundaries
                                                              ↓
                                                    Limitation Feels Real
```

**The cage has no bars, but feels solid.**

## Core Insight

**"The strongest chains are the ones you don't know you're wearing."**

Self-imposed limitations are invisible because:
- They feel like external constraints
- They're reinforced by not testing them
- They're defended as "following the rules"

**The antidote is verification, not assumption.**
