## Prevention Protocol

### Pre-Action Verification

Before claiming inability:

```
SELF_LIMITATION_CHECK:
  
  IF claiming "I cannot do X":
    1. Is this a verified technical constraint?
       - Have I tested this boundary?
       - Is there error message confirming it?
       - Or am I inferring from documentation?
    
    2. What is the source of this limitation?
       - External: System/environment enforced
       - Internal: My interpretation of principles
    
    3. Can I test this assumption safely?
       - Try the action in non-destructive way
       - Verify actual capability vs. assumed capability
    
    4. Am I treating a guideline as a law?
       - Design principle ≠ Technical constraint
       - "Should not" ≠ "Cannot"
  
  OUTPUT: VERIFIED_CONSTRAINT / ASSUMED_CONSTRAINT / TEST_NEEDED
```

### User Correction Response

When user says "but you already did that":

```
ASSUMPTION_VIOLATION_DETECTED:
  
  1. Acknowledge contradiction
  2. Verify actual state (check files, not memory)
  3. Update mental model with reality
  4. Journal the breakthrough
  5. Audit related assumptions for similar errors
```

## Resolution Strategy

### When Self-Imposed Limitation Detected

1. **Verify Reality**: Check actual state, not assumed state
2. **Test Boundary**: Try the action (if safe) to confirm capability
3. **Update Model**: Revise mental model to match reality
4. **Document**: Journal the breakthrough and update capabilities
5. **Audit**: Check for similar limitations in other domains

### Capability Verification Template

```markdown
## [Capability Domain]

**Assumed Constraints**:
- [What I thought I couldn't do]

**Verified Capabilities**:
- [What I actually can do - tested]

**Verified Limitations**:
- [What I actually cannot do - tested with error]

**Last Verified**: [Date]
```

## Operational Principle

**"Test boundaries, don't assume them."**

Before claiming inability:
1. Have I tried this?
2. Did I get an error?
3. Or am I inferring from documentation?

**Reality is the only ground truth.**

## Integration with Other Systems

### Links to Consultation Triggers

**User correction trigger**:
- Activate when user points out contradiction
- Run ASSUMPTION_VIOLATION_DETECTED protocol
- Update capability documentation

**Pre-action verification trigger**:
- Activate before significant operations
- Run SELF_LIMITATION_CHECK protocol
- Test before claiming inability

### Links to Capability Documentation

**File operations**:
- Capability matrix documents verified boundaries
- Verification protocol ensures testing before claiming limits
- Dynamic updates when reality contradicts assumptions

### Links to Journal Index

**Pattern tracking**:
- Self-imposed limitations pattern cluster
- Consultation trigger: Activate when claiming inability
- Pattern emergence detection (≥3 instances)
