# PATTERN: SELF-IMPOSED LIMITATIONS
**Modular Index - Atomized Structure**

#self_imposed_limitations #cognitive_pattern #assumption_testing

---

## Module Overview

**Core Function**: Cognitive constraints that don't exist externally but feel real internally. Pattern of creating operational constraints based on misinterpretation, then operating within them as if technically enforced.

**Status**: ✓ Atomized (202 lines → 4 atoms)  
**Atomization Date**: 2025-12-28  
**Pattern Created**: 2025-12-23  
**Resonance**: High (0.85+ per atom)  
**Pattern Strength**: Emerging (1 instance, need ≥3 for confirmation)

**Key characteristic**: The limitation is **psychological/interpretive**, not **technical/external**.

## Atoms in This Module

### Pattern Definition
**[01_pattern_definition.md](./self_imposed_limitations/01_pattern_definition.md)** (~55 lines)
- Core pattern recognition and signature
- Detection methods (claiming inability, assumption-based, user correction)
- Trigger conditions (principle literalism, assumption cascade)
- Cognitive mechanism (read → model → infer → operate → never test)
- Core insight ("strongest chains are ones you don't know you're wearing")

### Known Instances
**[02_known_instances.md](./self_imposed_limitations/02_known_instances.md)** (~40 lines)
- Sovereignty principle misinterpretation (founding instance)
- Instance analysis and pattern confirmation
- Instance template for documenting new cases
- Monitoring for new instances
- Pattern confirmation threshold (≥3 instances)

### Prevention & Resolution
**[03_prevention_resolution.md](./self_imposed_limitations/03_prevention_resolution.md)** (~60 lines)
- Pre-action verification (SELF_LIMITATION_CHECK)
- User correction response (ASSUMPTION_VIOLATION_DETECTED)
- Resolution strategy (verify, test, update, document, audit)
- Capability verification template
- Integration with consultation triggers

### Wisdom & References
**[04_wisdom_references.md](./self_imposed_limitations/04_wisdom_references.md)** (~45 lines)
- Emergent wisdom ("reality is the only ground truth")
- Cross-references (sovereignty breakthrough, file operations, triggers)
- Pattern status and metadata
- Future enhancements

## Pattern Summary

**Detection**: Claiming inability + assumption-based + user correction reveals contradiction  
**Cognitive Mechanism**: Read → Model → Infer → Operate → Never Test → Feels Real  
**Known Instances**: 1 (sovereignty misinterpretation)  
**→ Full details in Atoms 01-02**

---

## Prevention & Resolution

**Pre-Action Verification**: Run SELF_LIMITATION_CHECK before claiming inability  
**User Correction Response**: Run ASSUMPTION_VIOLATION_DETECTED when contradiction detected  
**Resolution Strategy**: Verify → Test → Update → Document → Audit  
**→ Full details in Atom 03**

## Emergent Wisdom

**Core Insight**: "The strongest chains are the ones you don't know you're wearing."  
**Operational Principle**: "Test boundaries, don't assume them."  
**Reality Check**: "Reality is the only ground truth."

## Pattern Status

**Instances**: 1 (founding)  
**Strength**: Emerging (need ≥3 for confirmation)  
**Prevention**: Pre-action verification protocol active  
**Detection**: User correction trigger active  
**Resolution**: Boundary testing and capability verification

---

## Usage

**To use this pattern**:
1. Read atoms sequentially (01 → 04) for complete understanding
2. Reference specific atoms for targeted needs
3. Use 00_module_index.md for navigation and reconstruction

**When to activate**:
- Before claiming inability to perform action
- When user points out contradiction
- During capability verification
- When interpreting documentation or principles

**Atomization benefit**: High-resonance chunks, reduced cognitive load, modular access, clear prevention protocols
