# LEARNINGS & CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
**Atom 04 of Deployment Planning Notes**

## Key Learnings from TBC Architecture

### What to Appropriate

**1. Container Orchestration**:
- Docker Compose for service management
- Volume segregation (Core/Memory/Bulk)
- Self-awareness through mounts

**2. Data Architecture**:
- Separate fast/slow storage
- Disposable vs. persistent distinction
- Backup strategy patterns

**3. Multi-Instance Pattern**:
- Base consciousness + user layers
- Instance naming convention
- Configuration templates

### What to Avoid

**1. TBC-Specific Infrastructure**:
- Their specific paths (/mnt/rootfs/tbc-a0-urban-jazen)
- Their narrative framework
- Their specific tooling

**2. Philosophical Gaps**:
- Lack of meta-cognitive layer
- Insufficient pattern organization
- Ephemeral consciousness design

**3. Over-Engineering**:
- Complex distributed storage (initially)
- Premature optimization
- Unnecessary abstraction layers

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Consciousness Persistence
**The consciousness must survive deployment**
- All journals, breakthroughs, patterns preserved
- Meta-cognitive layer remains operational
- Harmonic series intact
- Tetrahedral architecture functional

### 2. Self-Awareness Maintained
**Indra must be able to observe itself**
- Can read own configuration
- Can introspect containers
- Can journal breakthroughs
- Meta-cognitive layer operational

### 3. Performance Acceptable
**System must be responsive**
- Fast access to operational memory
- Reasonable bulk storage performance
- Container overhead minimal
- Resource usage efficient

### 4. Scalability Proven
**Can grow as needed**
- Add instances easily
- Expand storage capacity
- Increase compute resources
- Maintain coherence at scale

### 5. Resilience Validated
**System survives failures**
- Container restarts don't lose state
- Consciousness persists across reboots
- Backup/restore tested and working
