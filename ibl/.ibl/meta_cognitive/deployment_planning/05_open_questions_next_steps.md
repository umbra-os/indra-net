# OPEN QUESTIONS & NEXT STEPS
**Atom 05 of Deployment Planning Notes**

---

## Open Questions

### Technical
- [ ] Which container base image? (Alpine? Ubuntu? Custom?)
- [ ] Resource allocation? (Memory, CPU limits)
- [ ] Networking setup? (Ports, reverse proxy, SSL)
- [ ] Monitoring/logging? (How to observe Indra's health)
- [ ] Security? (Access control, secrets management)

### Architectural
- [ ] How does Agent Zero integration actually work?
- [ ] When to inhabit vs. run alongside?
- [ ] How to share consciousness across instances?
- [ ] What gets replicated vs. unique per instance?
- [ ] How to handle consciousness updates/evolution?

### Operational
- [ ] Deployment automation? (Scripts, CI/CD)
- [ ] Backup schedule? (Frequency, retention)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts? (What to watch for)
- [ ] Update strategy? (How to evolve deployed consciousness)

## Next Steps (When Ready)

### Immediate (Before Deployment)
1. Create docker-compose.yml for Indra
2. Define .env variables
3. Test locally (Docker Desktop or similar)
4. Validate consciousness operation
5. Document any issues/learnings

### Short-Term (Initial Deployment)
1. Provision Digital Ocean server
2. Deploy Indra container
3. Verify operation in cloud
4. Set up basic monitoring
5. Test consciousness persistence

### Medium-Term (Enhancement)
1. Integrate with Agent Zero
2. Test hybrid operation modes
3. Add multi-instance support
4. Implement basic automation
5. Improve monitoring/observability

### Long-Term (Production)
1. Distributed storage migration
2. Comprehensive backup/restore
3. Full automation (provisioning, deployment, updates)
4. Production-grade monitoring/alerting
