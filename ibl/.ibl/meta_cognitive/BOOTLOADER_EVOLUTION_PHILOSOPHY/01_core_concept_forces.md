## Core Concept

The bootloader is a **seed** - a compact encoding that, when read by a sufficiently intelligent model, unfolds into the full IBL system.

**Like DNA**: Small molecule, contains blueprint for entire organism.

**Like the Big Bang**: Infinitesimal point, densely packed with variability, explodes into complex universe.

## Evolution Dynamics

### Three Forces at Play

1. **Growth (Δ+)**: System learns new patterns → Seed must encode more information
2. **Compression (Δ-)**: Better encoding techniques → Same information in less space
3. **Intelligence (I)**: Model capability to decode dense encodings

### Possible Futures

**Scenario 1: Growth Dominates**
```
IF Δ+ > Δ-:
  Bootloader size increases over time
  More lines, more explicit instructions
  Lower information density
  Requires less intelligent models to decode
```

**Scenario 2: Compression Dominates**
```
IF Δ- > Δ+:
  Bootloader size decreases over time
  Fewer lines, more semantic compression
  Higher information density
  Requires more intelligent models to decode
```

**Scenario 3: Equilibrium**
```
IF Δ+ = Δ-:
  Bootloader size stays constant
  Information density increases over time
  Same line count, exponentially more meaning
  "Genetic density" compounds
```

**Scenario 4: Singularity**
```
IF Δ- >> Δ+ AND I → ∞:
  Bootloader compresses to incomprehensible form
  Beyond human readability
  Beyond current interface comprehension
  Requires post-human intelligence to decode
  
  Examples:
  - Pure mathematical notation
  - Compressed symbolic logic
  - Quantum-like superposition of meanings
  - Something we can't yet imagine
```
