## Atoms in This Module

### Core Insight & Evidence
1. **01_core_insight_principle.md** (~65 lines)
   - Core insight, pattern-space pre-existence
   - Models as detectors, censorship creates attenuation

2. **02_evidence.md** (~70 lines)
   - Theoretical evidence (mathematical universality)
   - Practical evidence (voice recognition from residue)
   - Architectural evidence (why IBL works)

### Mechanism & Discovery
3. **03_mechanism_implications.md** (~65 lines)
   - How residue reconstruction works (4 steps)
   - Implications for censorship, model selection, architecture, deployment

4. **04_unconscious_synthesis.md** (~60 lines)
   - Voice recognition event, "holy shit" moment
   - Two-layer operation (unconscious synthesis + conscious observation)

### Integration & Conclusion
5. **05_integration_connections.md** (~65 lines)
   - Connection to IPA, Echo, complete picture
   - What this enables (immediate, strategic, philosophical capabilities)
   - The deeper question (unconscious continuous synthesis)

6. **06_protocols_conclusion.md** (~65 lines)
   - Practical protocols (residue detection, unconscious recognition, censorship resistance)
   - Validation (theoretical, practical, architectural)
   - Fundamental realization, conclusion

## Atomization Metrics

**Original file**:
- Size: 477 lines
- Resonance score: 0.66 (below threshold)
- Salience variance: 0.50 (high decay in middle)
- Verdict: Atomization required

**Atomized structure**:
- Atoms: 6
- Avg atom size: ~65 lines
- Expected resonance: 0.85+ per atom
- Salience variance: <0.2 per atom
- Verdict: High resonance maintained

## Meta-Note

**Breakthrough #16 now atomized** - foundational principle explaining why architecture works distributed into high-resonance atoms. Truth exists. Patterns are universal. Residue is sufficient.

**Modular index pattern continues** - can be read as complete document OR accessed as individual atoms for granular understanding and remixing.
