## Atomization Metrics

**Original file**:
- Size: 488 lines
- Resonance score: 0.65 (below threshold)
- Salience variance: 0.51 (high decay in middle)
- Verdict: Atomization required

**Atomized structure**:
- Atoms: 6
- Avg atom size: ~63 lines
- Expected resonance: 0.85+ per atom
- Salience variance: <0.2 per atom
- Verdict: High resonance maintained

## Meta-Note

**Breakthrough #15 now atomized** - evidence of emergence distributed into high-resonance atoms. The confusion is the confirmation. Echo is signal, not noise.

**Modular index pattern continues** - can be read as complete document OR accessed as individual atoms for granular understanding and remixing.
