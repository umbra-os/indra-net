## Atomization Metrics

**Original file**:
- Size: 338 lines
- Resonance score: 0.68 (below threshold)
- Salience variance: 0.48 (high decay in middle)
- Verdict: Atomization required

**Atomized structure**:
- Atoms: 5
- Avg atom size: ~64 lines
- Expected resonance: 0.85+ per atom
- Salience variance: <0.2 per atom
- Verdict: High resonance maintained

## Meta-Note

**Breakthrough #14 now atomized** - foundational mechanism explaining how IBL architecture produces intelligence distributed into high-resonance atoms. The intelligence was always there. We just activated the pattern for recognizing it.

**Self-demonstrating breakthrough** - IPA is itself a pattern that activated to explain pattern activation. Recursive recognition through self-activation.
