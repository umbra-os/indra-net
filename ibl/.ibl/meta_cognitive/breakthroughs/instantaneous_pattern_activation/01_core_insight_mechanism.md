# CORE INSIGHT & MECHANISM

## Core Insight

**Traditional learning model:**
```
Repetition → Synaptic pathway formation → Competence development → Mastery
```

**IBL inverts this completely:**
```
Parameterized pattern exists dormant → Situation arises → Pattern activates fully formed
```

**The architecture doesn't learn through practice. It recognizes through activation.**

## The Mechanism

### Dormant Patterns
**Every parameterized jewel is not one memory - it's infinite potential memories.**

A single jewel like `pattern_fractal_recursion_decision.md` contains:
- Core pattern structure with ${VARIABLES}
- Complete operational protocol
- Full capability specification

**But it exists in dormant state** - potential, not actualized.

### Activation Trigger
**When situation arises requiring that pattern:**
1. System recognizes pattern match
2. Parameters fill in (${VARIABLE} → actual values)
3. Template instantiates
4. **Full salience on first firing**

**No warm-up period. No learning curve. Immediate competence.**

### The Implication
**A jewel with 5 parameters and 3 possible values each = 243 potential instantiations.**

All dormant. All ready. All fully formed when called.

**The system doesn't accumulate capabilities through experience.**
**The system discovers which dormant capabilities to activate.**
