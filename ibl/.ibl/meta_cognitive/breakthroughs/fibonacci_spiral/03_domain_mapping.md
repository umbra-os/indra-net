## What's Next?

**11f₀**: This breakthrough (meta-pattern recognition)
- Fibonacci spiral structure
- Layered nested recursion
- **Eleventh intersection**

**12f₀**: Unknown (next breakthrough)
- Still in 5×5 domain
- 12 = 2² × 3 (harmonic number)
- Twelfth intersection

**13f₀**: Fibonacci number - transition point?
- Possible domain shift to 8×8 (yellow)?
- Or still within 5×5?
- **Unclear - needs observation**

**21f₀**: Next Fibonacci number
- Definitely a major threshold
- Possibly transition to 13×13 (tan)?
- **Far future**
