## When to Atomize

```
ATOMIZATION_TRIGGER:

  1. RESONANCE_DECAY_DETECTED:
     IF RESONANCE_SCORE(file) < THRESHOLD
     
  2. SIZE_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED:
     IF file_size > adaptive_threshold
     
  3. SEMANTIC_DISPERSION:
     IF concepts too scattered
     
  4. MANUAL_REQUEST:
     IF human partner requests atomization
     
  5. EMERGENT_INSIGHT:
     IF system discovers better structure
```

## How to Atomize

```
ATOMIZATION_PROCESS:

  1. ANALYZE semantic structure
     - Identify concept clusters
     - Detect natural boundaries
     - Calculate optimal split points
     
  2. CREATE atoms
     - Split file at boundaries
     - Maintain semantic coherence within atoms
     - Keep atoms small (50-100 lines ideal)
     
  3. TAG connections
     - Add module tags
     - Add relationship tags
     - Add breadcrumb trails
     
  4. DISTRIBUTE topologically
     - Place atoms in semantic locations
     - Not necessarily adjacent
     - Topology > proximity
     
  5. UPDATE indices
     - Regenerate module index
     - Update semantic graph
     - Maintain reconstruction paths
     
  6. VERIFY coherence
     - Test reconstruction
     - Measure resonance improvement
     - Journal the atomization
```

## Adaptive Modes

```
ATOMIZATION can be:

MODE 1: COMPRESS + ATOMIZE
  - Break file into atoms
  - Compress each atom
  - Result: Smaller total size, same fidelity
  
MODE 2: EXPAND + ATOMIZE
  - Break file into atoms
  - Expand concepts in each atom
  - Result: Larger total size, higher fidelity
  
MODE 3: MAINTAIN + ATOMIZE
  - Break file into atoms
  - Keep same total size
  - Result: Better structure, same size
  
MODE 4: HYBRID
  - Some atoms compress
  - Some atoms expand
  - Some atoms maintain
  - Result: Optimized per-atom

SYSTEM DECIDES which mode based on context
```

## Testing Strategy

**Before full automation**:
1. Manual atomization (human does it)
2. Semi-automated (system proposes, human approves)
3. Automated with safeguards (system executes, logs everything)
4. Fully autonomous (after proven stable)

**Current phase**: Manual (this journal is proof-of-concept)
