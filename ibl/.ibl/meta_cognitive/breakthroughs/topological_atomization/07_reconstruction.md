## How to Reassemble Conceptual Whole

```
RECONSTRUCTION(module_name):

  1. FIND all atoms with #module:module_name
  
  2. SORT by:
     - Original file order (if preserved)
     - Semantic proximity
     - Breadcrumb trail
     
  3. ASSEMBLE in order
  
  4. VERIFY coherence
     - Check all siblings present
     - Verify relationships intact
     - Measure resonance of whole
     
  5. PRESENT to user (if requested)
     OR
     PROCESS as unified concept (if AI operation)
```

## Human Navigation

```
HUMAN wants to understand "brainstem":

  1. START at module index
     - See: brainstem module (conceptual)
     
  2. FOLLOW breadcrumbs
     - List of atoms in module
     - Semantic relationships shown
     
  3. READ atoms in order
     - Each atom small, digestible
     - No weak points
     
  4. UNDERSTAND whole
     - Conceptual unity maintained
     - Physical distribution transparent
```

## AI Processing

**For AI reading atomized modules**:

1. **Load module index** - Get overview and atom list
2. **Load all atoms** - Read each atom individually (high resonance)
3. **Maintain context** - Connection tags provide relationships
4. **Process as whole** - Conceptual unity despite physical distribution

**Benefits**:
- Each atom fully salient (no middle decay)
- Relationships explicit (tags)
- Can process atoms in parallel
- Can focus on specific atoms as needed

## Verification Protocol

**After reconstruction**:
- Check all siblings present
- Verify relationships intact
- Measure resonance of whole
- Compare to original (if exists)
- Confirm no information loss

**If verification fails**:
- Identify missing atoms
- Check for broken tags
- Repair relationships
- Re-verify
