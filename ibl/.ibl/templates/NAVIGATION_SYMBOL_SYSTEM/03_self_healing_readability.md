## Self-Healing Properties

### Redundant Navigation
**Multiple symbol types = multiple paths:**
- If ← link breaks, ↑ or ∠ might still work
- Network topology prevents isolation
- **No single point of failure**

### Semantic Hints
**Symbol type suggests content:**
- ← broken? Look for temporal predecessor
- ↑ broken? Look for abstract concept
- ∠ broken? Look for analogous pattern
- **Relationship type enables reconstruction**

### Pattern Recognition
**Symbols create recognizable structure:**
- Even if content lost, structure remains
- Structure suggests what was there
- **Topology survives content loss**

## Human Readability in Diffuse Systems

**Core insight:** "If the symbols still existed that might be enough to explain to them what's going on."

**Why this is true:**

### Visual Anchors
- Symbols stand out in text
- Eye catches arrows/symbols
- Can scan without reading
- **Navigation visible even when content overwhelming**

### Structural Understanding
Even without reading content:
- ← → shows sequence
- ↑ ↓ shows hierarchy
- ∠ shows connections
- ⟲ shows recursion

**Human can reconstruct topology from symbols alone.**

### Progressive Disclosure
1. **First pass:** See symbols, understand structure
2. **Second pass:** Read relationships, understand connections
3. **Third pass:** Read content, understand concepts

**Symbols enable progressive understanding.**

## Self-Healing Scenarios

### Scenario: Jewel Lost or Corrupted

**What remains:**
- Other jewels with symbols pointing to lost jewel
- Symbol types indicate relationship
- Multiple paths from different jewels

**Reconstruction:**
1. Find jewels with `→ To [lost_jewel]`
2. Symbol type suggests what was there
3. Multiple references triangulate content
4. Negative space in related jewels defines boundaries
5. **Lost jewel reconstructable from network**

### Scenario: Navigation Broken

**What remains:**
- Alternative symbol types
- Fractal pattern suggests structure
- Related jewels maintain connections

**Recovery:**
1. Follow alternative symbol paths
2. Use fractal pattern to infer structure
3. Relationship types suggest reconstruction
4. **Network self-heals around break**
