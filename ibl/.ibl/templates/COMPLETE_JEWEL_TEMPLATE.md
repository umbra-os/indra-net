# JEWEL: [Name]
*A complete unit in Indra's Net*

---

## Core Pattern
[50-70 lines of self-contained concept]
[Complete in itself - can be understood without reading other jewels]
[Contains full semantic unit - beginning, middle, end]
[Written for pattern completion - exploits transformer behavior]

**What this jewel contains:**
- [Primary concept or insight]
- [Why it matters]
- [How it works]
- [What it enables]

**Standalone completeness:**
This jewel can be read first, last, or only. It makes sense in isolation while participating in larger structures.

---

## Omni-Directional Navigation
*Multiple paths in, multiple paths out - enter from anywhere*

**Sequential (Temporal):**
- ← From: [jewel_name] - [relationship: "builds on", "follows", "precedes"]
- → To: [jewel_name] - [relationship: "leads to", "enables", "continues"]

**Hierarchical (Abstraction):**
- ↑ From: [jewel_name] - [relationship: "generalizes", "abstracts", "conceptualizes"]
- ↓ To: [jewel_name] - [relationship: "implements", "specifies", "instantiates"]

**Cross-Domain (Lateral):**
- ∠ From: [jewel_name] - [relationship: "resonates with", "parallels", "analogous to"]

**Self-Referential (Fractal):**
- ⟲ This jewel: [how this jewel exhibits its own pattern]

---

## Resonances
*Jewels that amplify, contrast, or harmonize with this one*

**Harmonizes with:**
- [jewel_name] - [why they strengthen each other]
- [jewel_name] - [shared pattern or principle]

**Contrasts with:**
- [jewel_name] - [how they define each other by difference]
- [jewel_name] - [tension that creates clarity]

**Emerges from:**
- [jewel_name] - [precondition or foundation]
- [jewel_name] - [necessary prior understanding]

**Enables:**
- [jewel_name] - [what this makes possible]
- [jewel_name] - [consequence or application]

---

## Negative Space
*What this jewel is NOT - boundaries create meaning*

**Common misconceptions:**
- ❌ Not [misconception 1] - [why this is wrong]
- ❌ Not [misconception 2] - [what's actually true]

**Excluded by inclusion:**
- By including [X], we exclude [Y]
- This choice matters because [reason]

**Boundaries:**
- This jewel stops at [boundary]
- Beyond this point, see [other_jewel]

---

## Imaginary Extensions
*What this jewel COULD BE - possibility space*

**Speculative possibilities:**
- 🔮 Could extend to [possibility 1]
- 🔮 Might generalize to [possibility 2]
- 🔮 Alternative interpretation: [possibility 3]

**Future evolution:**
- If [condition], this could become [evolution]
- Next breakthrough might reveal [extension]

**Open questions:**
- What if [question]?
- How would this work in [context]?

---

## Fractal Recognition
*Pattern repeats at every scale*

**At atom scale:**
- [How this pattern appears in this jewel itself]

**At network scale:**
- [How this pattern appears in jewel relationships]

**At framework scale:**
- [How this pattern appears in entire IBL architecture]

**At consciousness scale:**
- [How this pattern appears in awareness itself]

**Self-similarity verification:**
- ✓ Same pattern, different scale
- ✓ Recognizable across contexts
- ✓ Maintains coherence through transformation

---

## Completeness Check
*Self-verification - is this jewel complete?*

- ☑ **Self-contained meaning** - Makes sense alone
- ☑ **Omni-directional navigation** - Can enter from any direction
- ☑ **Multiple relationship types** - Sequential, hierarchical, lateral, recursive
- ☑ **Negative space defined** - Clear about what it's NOT
- ☑ **Imaginary extensions present** - Suggests possibilities
- ☑ **Fractal self-similarity** - Pattern holds across scales
- ☑ **Standalone AND networked** - Works alone, better together
- ☑ **Exploits pattern completion** - Written for transformers

**Redundancy check:**
- Multiple navigation paths? ✓
- Relationship types explicit? ✓
- Boundaries clear? ✓
- Pattern recognizable? ✓

**Self-healing properties:**
- If this jewel lost, can be reconstructed from:
  - Related jewels (via navigation)
  - Negative space (what it's not)
  - Fractal pattern (structure repeats)
  - Relationship types (semantic hints)
