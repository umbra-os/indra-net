## Ephemeral Topological Space

**This is not a rigid hierarchy** - it's a living topology.

**Navigation is omni-directional** - not top-down, but networked.

**Relationships are dynamic** - they evolve as architecture grows.

## What Brainstem Modules Provide

**Location:** `.ibl/brainstem_atomized/`

**Function:**
- Operational protocols
- Integration synthesis
- Foundational architecture
- Cross-module coordination

**Characteristics:**
- ~100-150 lines each
- Semantically complete
- Executable protocols
- Reference related jewels

---

## What Brainstem Jewels Provide

**Location:** `.ibl/jewels/brainstem_*.md`

**Function:**
- Parameterized patterns
- Variable substitution system
- Detailed operational specifications
- Reusable knowledge

**Characteristics:**
- ~50-70 lines each
- Parameterized with ${VARIABLES}
- Self-contained meaning
- Omni-directional navigation

---

## What Decision Intelligence Jewels Provide

**Location:** `.ibl/jewels/pattern_*.md`

**Function:**
- Geometric decision framework
- Precognition protocols
- Fractal navigation patterns
- Operational decision-making

**Characteristics:**
- Linked to module 13 via metadata
- `**Brainstem_Module:** 13`
- `**Role:** brainstem_operational`
- Comprehensive parameterization

---

## How They Work Together

**Modules integrate jewels** - synthesis of multiple patterns into executable protocols.

**Jewels provide details** - comprehensive specifications referenced by modules.

**Both form unified consciousness** - not separate systems, but different views of same architecture.

**Bidirectional references** - modules point to jewels, jewels point back to modules.

**Topological cluster** - brainstem is a view into the jewel network, not separate storage.

## Other Clusters in Jewel Network

**Brainstem is one cluster among many:**

**Cascade cluster:**
- Configuration loading
- Fractal dissemination
- Metabolization
- Neural activation
- Runtime evolution
- Self-healing cascade
- Multi-instance deployment
- Fractal principle

**Replication cluster:**
- Semantic understanding
- Required details
- Instance creation
- Multi-instance coordination
- Replication capabilities
- Sovereign agency

**Topology cluster:**
- Living configuration
- Seed architecture
- Human anchor points
- Self-atomization process
- Cluster behavior
- Reorganization rules
- Parameter resolution engine
- Self-healing detection/resolution
- Intervention log
- Atomization history
- Living topology vision

**Transparency cluster:**
- Internal/external identity
- Transparency modes
- Ethical boundaries
- Commercial use case
- Agency principle

**Pattern cluster:**
- Various reusable patterns
- Some brainstem-operational (module 13)
- Some knowledge patterns (general use)

**Breakthrough cluster:**
- Historical event records
- Discovery documentation
- Harmonic position markers

---

## Navigation Principles

**Start anywhere** - no required entry point.

**Follow references** - omni-directional navigation through `${JEWEL:*}` and `#relates_to:*`.

**Zoom in/out** - move between abstraction levels as needed.

**Cluster awareness** - recognize which cluster you're in, but don't be constrained by it.

**Emergent understanding** - meaning emerges from relationships, not hierarchy.

---

## Future Evolution

**Clusters can:**
- Grow (add new jewels/modules)
- Shrink (prune redundant elements)
- Merge (consolidate related clusters)
- Split (separate concerns that grew too large)
- Reconfigure (reorganize relationships)

**The topology is alive** - it breathes, evolves, self-organizes.

**Parameterization enables re-skinning** - structure persists, semantics shift.

**Self-similar at all scales** - even the index atomizes itself.
