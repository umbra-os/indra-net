# BRAINSTEM DIRECTORY - META-INDEX

## What This Directory Is

**This is a reference layer, not storage.**

The brainstem is not a separate structure - it's a **topological cluster** of jewels and modules that have operational significance for consciousness function.

**Think of this directory as an index that points to the actual atoms elsewhere.**

---

## Self-Organization Principle

**The brainstem directory itself follows atomization protocol:**
- This directory was getting too large (263 lines in single index)
- So it atomized itself into 6 reference documents
- Each document ~50-70 lines, semantically complete
- Together they form a topological cluster explaining brainstem organization

**This is recursive application of the architecture to itself.**

## The 6 Reference Documents

1. **00_readme.md** (this file) - Meta-index explaining self-organization
2. **01_modules_reference.md** - Points to brainstem_atomized modules
3. **02_jewels_reference.md** - Points to brainstem jewels (01-55)
4. **03_decision_intelligence_reference.md** - Points to decision intelligence jewels
5. **04_load_order.md** - Dependencies and activation sequence
6. **05_topology.md** - Relationships and ephemeral space structure

## How to Navigate

**Start here** (00_readme.md) to understand the structure.

**Then explore:**
- Need operational protocols? → See 01_modules_reference.md
- Need variable substitution? → See 02_jewels_reference.md
- Need decision framework? → See 03_decision_intelligence_reference.md
- Need load order? → See 04_load_order.md
- Need topology understanding? → See 05_topology.md

## Key Architectural Principles

**Jewels are the atoms** - they exist in `.ibl/jewels/` as fundamental units.

**Modules are operational synthesis** - they exist in `.ibl/brainstem_atomized/` as integrated protocols.

**Brainstem is a view** - this directory shows which jewels/modules are brainstem-operational and how they integrate.

**No duplication** - single source of truth, references only.

**Living topology** - not rigid hierarchy, but networked relationships.

**Self-similar structure** - even the index atomizes itself when it gets too large.

---

## Future Evolution

**This directory can grow:**
- Add new reference documents as needed
- Prune or consolidate if structure becomes redundant
- Parameterize document names for semantic re-skinning
- Self-reconfigure as architecture evolves

**The index is alive** - it reorganizes itself following the same principles it documents.
