## Reading This Document

**As Complete Unit** (Composite View):
Read this index straight through - all content summarized below.

**As Individual Atoms** (Modular View):
Navigate to `./living_topology_protocol/` - read atoms individually at ~70 lines each.

**Both views valid.** System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

## BREAKTHROUGH & ARCHITECTURE
**→ Full Detail**: `./living_topology_protocol/01_breakthrough_architecture.md`

**The Breakthrough:** Configuration itself is living. It atomizes when dense, compresses when sparse, reorganizes based on actual structure. The JSON files break themselves down through their own rules.

**Not static hierarchy.** Not manual organization. **Emergent topology from explicit seeds.**

**SEED.json Architecture:**
- Anchors (human control), Resolution Engine (parameter interpreter), Self-Healing (immune system) stay in seed
- Topology, Metadata, Relationships atomize when dense
- Breathes: Expands when system grows, compresses when shrinks

---

## HUMAN ANCHOR POINTS
**→ Full Detail**: `./living_topology_protocol/02_human_anchor_points.md`

**Where humans control system temperature:**

1. **Topology Temperature**: max_cluster_density, split_threshold, merge_threshold, auto_organization_enabled
2. **Evolution Bounds**: Control what system can change (topology, relationships, identity)
3. **Hardcoded Overrides**: Delete parameter, write literal value (system detects and resolves around it)

**Global temperature shift from single parameter change.**

## SELF-ATOMIZATION & LIVING TOPOLOGY
**→ Full Detail**: `./living_topology_protocol/03_atomization_topology.md`

**Self-Atomization:**
- Triggers: File size > 10KB, cluster count > 8, jewel count > 55
- SEED.json splits into config_topology.json, config_metadata.json, config_relationships.json
- Recursive atomization (each file can split further)
- Compression: Merges back when total_size < 5KB (ephemeral atomization)

**Living Topology:**
- Clusters have density centers, members, thresholds
- Lifecycle: Form → grow → split (when dense) → merge (when sparse)
- Auto-discover clusters via semantic proximity
- All automatic, based on anchor point settings

---

## PARAMETER RESOLUTION
**→ Full Detail**: `./living_topology_protocol/04_parameter_resolution.md`

**Resolution Engine:**
- ${VARIABLES} resolve at read-time (files stay templates)
- Cascade priority: Runtime > Extension > Anchor > Calculated > Default
- Calculated values never stored (JEWEL_POSITION, CLUSTER_DENSITY, etc.)
- Math is parameterized (rules for calculating, not values)

**If human changes anchor, all clusters immediately use new threshold.**

---

## SELF-HEALING & INTERVENTION LOG
**→ Full Detail**: `./living_topology_protocol/05_self_healing_intervention.md`

**Self-Healing:**
- Detects: Broken references, missing jewels, circular dependencies, density violations, parameter conflicts, orphaned jewels, duplicates
- Resolves automatically: Find similar, reconstruct, break weakest link, trigger split/merge, apply cascade priority
- Alerts human only when: Cannot auto-resolve, anchor affected, identity change, data loss risk

**Intervention Log:**
- Tracks human interventions (hardcoded overrides, anchor modifications)
- System knows when humans intervene and why
- Transparency: Full record of human temperature changes

---

## ATOMIZATION HISTORY, EXAMPLES & VISION
**→ Full Detail**: `./living_topology_protocol/06_history_examples_vision.md`

**Atomization History:**
- Configuration tracks its own evolution (seed_created, first_atomization, compression events)
- Configuration has memory

**Usage Examples:**
1. System grows → config atomizes (60 jewels triggers split)
2. Human changes temperature → system reorganizes (max_cluster_density: 12→8 triggers global split)
3. Cluster shrinks → system compresses (density < 3 triggers merge)

**The Vision:**
- Configuration atomizes itself, topology self-organizes, parameters resolve dynamically
- System self-heals, human controls temperature, intervention tracked, history preserved
- **The system breathes.** Files become projection surfaces. Real system lives in parameters.

## META-NOTE: MODULAR INDEX PATTERN

**Living Topology Protocol now atomized** - configuration protocol enabling self-organizing, breathing structure distributed into high-resonance atoms.

**Pattern established**: This modular index presents as complete document (composite view) while pointing to 6 distributed atoms (modular view). System can read sequentially, as full unit, or remix/chain pieces.

**No resonant decay**: Each atom ~70 lines, high salience throughout, full coherence maintained through index.

**This protocol is itself a jewel - complete, networked, self-healing, and describing a living system that includes itself.**
